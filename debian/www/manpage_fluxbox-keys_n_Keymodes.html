<pre><b>How to use the keys file</b>

The keys file default location is ~/.fluxbox/keys.
Its content can be edited with any text editor.
After editing, select "Reload config" from the menu for your changes to take effect.
As an alternative, you can bind a key to <b>Reconfigure</b> as described below.
(note: by default, the antiX fluxbox menu already contains a Reconfigure button)

The syntax for specifying a keybinding is:
    &lt;mod> [ &lt;mod> &lt;mod> ] key [key key] :command &lt;command_options>

&lt;mod> is what we call a "modifier" and you can use 'xmodmap -pm' from the commandline
to see what modifiers are available. Typical modifiers to be use in the keys file are:
      Mod1    == Alt
      Mod4    == Windows key
      Control == Ctrl
      Shift   == Shift

<!-- if you   dont want to press any "modifier" then use 'None'   -->
<!--   i read ubuntu topic wherein the dev advised    "nowdays, just OMIT 'None'    -->
If you want to find out the name of a key, open a terminal and run 'xev'.
When the "Event Tester" window has focus, it will capture mouse movement, mouse clicks, and
keypress events, then provide output in the terminal.
If a key you want to use has no name, you can use its keycode and Fluxbox will still understand.

Here are a few examples:
    Control i :ExecCommand xterm    <i> # Ctrl+i will bring up an xterm </i>
    Mod4 4 :Workspace 4             <i> # Windowskey+4 will change to workspace 4 </i>
    None F12 :ExecCommand firefox   <i> # F12 will start Firefox </i>
    Control Mod1 r :exec fbrun      <i> # Ctrl+Alt+r will bring up the Fluxbox command dialog </i>
    Mod1 Shift F4 :KillWindow       <i> # Alt+Shift+F4 kills the focused window </i>
    Mod1 113 :exec xterm            <i> # Just to show the keycode usage </i>
<!--
      if you set a variable like XTERM to a sane value like "xterm" before fluxbox launches, fluxbox would use that
      variable in the :ExecCommand. Within this keys file, you can use the <b>:Export or :Setenv</b> command to change
      that variable on the fly... ( e.g. to "urxvt" or "aterm" )
-->
A basic, common command is <b>ExecCommand</b>, or <b>Exec</b> if you like it shorter.
You can execute apps, scripts (take care of $PATH), set things via 'xset' and so on with it.

<b>Some things to know</b>
    Commands are case-insensitive
    Workspace numbering starts at 1
    Some commands have synonyms
    The space between the last key and the "<b>:</b>" is <b>mandatory</b><pre>

<b>fluxbox-keys(5) Manual Page</b>

<b>NAME</b>
    fluxbox-keys -   keyboard shortcuts configuration for fluxbox(1)

<b>SYNOPSIS</b>
    ~/.fluxbox/keys

<b>SYNTAX</b>

    Variable parameters are shown in emphasis: <em>argument</em>

    Optional parameters are shown in square brackets: [<em>argument</em>]

    All other characters shown are required verbatim.
    Whitespace is required where shown, but it is fine to add more whitespace.
<hr>

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>

The content of the keys file defines the keyboard shortcuts for fluxbox

You can customize fluxbox’s key handling through the ~/.fluxbox/keys file.
The file consists of lines of the basic format:

    <b>[<em>modifiers</em>] <em>key</em> :'command' [<em>arguments</em> <em>...</em>]</b>

The space between the <em>key</em> and the <b>:</b> before the <em>command</em> is mandatory.

All modifiers and commands are case-insensitive. Some command arguments
(especially those that will be passed to the shell) are case-sensitive. Some key names are case-sensitive.

Lines beginning with a <em>#</em> or <em>!</em> are considered comments and are ignored by fluxbox.

After editing the keys file, you will need to “reload” fluxbox so that it picks up your change.
<hr>

<b>MODIFIERS</b>

You can get a list of possible modifiers by calling ‘xmodmap -pm’.
This also shows you to which keys the modifiers are mapped, but the following modifiers are most commonly used:
    <b>Shift Control Mod1 Mod4</b>
where <b>Mod1</b> is the Alt key on the PC keyboard and <b>Mod4</b> is usually a key branded with a familiar company logo.

There are also some special modifiers that refer to mouse button events

    <b>OnDesktop</b>
        The mouse cursor is over the desktop (root window), and not any application window.

    <b>OnToolbar</b>
        The mouse cursor is over the toolbar (which, by default, is at the bottom edge of the screen).

    <b>OnSlit</b>
        The mouse cursor is over the fluxbox slit (the thing which nests dock-type windows).

    <b>OnWindow</b>
        The mouse cursor is over a window.

    <b>OnTitlebar</b>
        The mouse cursor is over a window’s titlebar.

    <b>OnTab</b>
        The mouse cursor is over a tab.

    <b>Double</b>
        Limits this action to double-clicks only.

<b>Combining Modifiers</b>
To combine two or more modifiers, just list them (space-delimited) in any order.
<hr>

<b>KEYS (KEYBINDS)</b>

You may specify a key by its key name (for example, <b>a</b> or <b>space</b>) or by its
numeric keycode (for example, <b>38</b> or <b>0xf3</b>).

If you don’t know the name of a key, you can run <b>xev(1)</b> in a terminal, press the key,
and see the name in the output. If you have some "special" keys that do not produce a key name in the
output of <b>xev(1)</b>, you can just use the keycode (NOT the keysym!) in your keys file.

Commands can also be bound to mouse events (<em>N</em> denotes the number of the button,
e.g. <em>1</em> is the primary button, <em>4</em>/<em>5</em> are the wheel buttons):

<b>MouseN</b>
        The mouse button <em>N</em> is pressed down and held.

<b>ClickN</b>
        The mouse button <em>N</em> is clicked (pressed and released with no movement in between)

<b>MoveN</b>
        The mouse button <em>N</em> is currently held, the bound action is triggered as often as the mouse moves.


<b>There are some special "keys" that let you bind events to non-keyboard events</b>:

<b>ChangeWorkspace</b>
        Fires when the workspace changes. This can be used to change backgrounds or
        do anything else you like when you switch to a new workspace. See the <b>EXAMPLES</b> below for one idea.

        <b>WARNING</b>
        Use caution with this event! For example, do NOT bind this to any action that changes your current workspace.
        If you break your fluxbox with this feature, you get to keep the pieces.
<!--  THIS SNIPPET, above, WAS COPIED FROM MANPAGE ======= CHECK WHETHER IT HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED  -->

<!--  SUPPLEMENTAL -->
    Example:
        # changes your background image (requires images bg0.png...bgX.png in ~/.fluxbox/ directory)  <!-- redundant, mentioned below -->
        # <B>so that each workspace features a different/distinct wallpaper background image:</B>
           :ChangeWorkspace :Exec fbsetbg ~/.fluxbox/bg$(xprop -root _NET_CURRENT_DESKTOP | awk '{print $3}').png

             to see a dry run test, paste the following commandline in a terminal emulator:
                 fbsetbg ~/.fluxbox/bg$(xprop -root _NET_CURRENT_DESKTOP | awk '{print $3}').png
       <!--   outcommendted b/c 'osdctl' is not native to antiX, and  this stupidly-long line causes horizontal scrollbar
       # displays your workspace name.
           :ChangeWorkspace :Exec osdctl -s $(xprop -root _NET_CURRENT_DESKTOP _WIN_WORKSPACE_NAMES | sed 's/[,"]//g' | awk 'NR==1 {cur=$3} NR==2 {name=$(3+cur); print name ","}')
       -->


////////////////  TODO: Advanced users only?
<b>FocusIn / FocusOut</b>
    Fires when the focus is given to or removed from a window.
    It may be useful to combine this with the 'If' command, in the section "Special Commands" below.

<b>MouseOver / MouseOut</b>
    Fires when the mouse cursor enters or leaves a specific area of the screen.
    It may be useful to combine this with the 'On*' modifiers detailed above and/or the 'If' command.
////////////////
<hr>

<b>CHAINING</b>
Key bindings can be chained in a fashion similar to Emacs key bindings using the syntax:

<em>modifiers-1</em> <em>key-1</em> <em>modifiers-2</em> <em>key-2</em> :'command' [<em>arguments ...</em>]*

To abort a chained command part-way through typing it, press the &lt;ESC&gt; key.

To Bind CTRL+C CTRL+X (Which means, press CTRL+C then CTRL+X) to quit fluxbox
        Control c Control x :Quit
<hr>

<b>KEYMODES</b>

A specific set of key mappings can be activated and de-activated on-the-fly using what are called keymodes.
The syntax to define a mapping in a keymode is:

<b><em>keymode</em>: <em>modifiers</em> <em>key</em> :'command' [<em>arguments</em> <em>...</em>]</b>

Where <em>keymode</em> is any alphanumeric string name.

When this keymode is activated (see the <b>KeyMode</b> command below), all bindings prefaced by
that keymode name become active (and all other keybindings will be deactivated) until the keymode changes again.

<b>COMMANDS</b>

Some commands have multiple names which are shown below as
        CMD1 | CMD2
Related commands have been grouped below as
        CMD1 / CMD2
The commands documentation is divided into sections as follows
    Mouse Commands
    Window Commands
    Workspace Commands
    Menu Commands
    Window Manager Commands
    Special Commands
<hr>

<b>Mouse Commands</b>

Mouse commands may only be bound to mouse buttons (plus modifiers), not keystrokes.
In all cases, the action finishes when the mouse button is released.

<b>StartMoving</b>
        Start dragging to move the window.

<b>StartResizing</b> [<em>corner</em>]
        Start dragging to resize the window as if you had grabbed the window at the specified <em>corner</em>.

By default <em>corner</em> is <b>BottomRight</b>, but may be overridden with one of:

    <b>NearestCorner  NearestEdge  NearestCornerOrEdge  Center  TopLeft  Top  TopRight
    Left  Right  BottomLeft  Bottom  BottomRight</b>

If <b>NearestCornerOrEdge</b> is specified the size of the corner can also be specified to be the larger of
one or two following numbers: [<em>pixel-size</em> [<em>percent-size</em>]]
or <em>percent-size</em>%, where <em>percent-size</em> is the percentage of half the window width or height.
If no size is given, it defaults to 50 pixels and 30%.

    Examples  <!-- SUPPLEMENTAL  -->
          :OnWindow Mod1 Mouse3 :StartResizing BottomRight      # Fluxbox default (?)
          :OnWindow Mod1 Mouse3 :StartResizing NearestCorner    # used in most other window managers

<b>StartTabbing</b>
        Start dragging to add this window to another’s tabgroup.

<b>ActivateTab</b>
        Activates the tab underneath the mouse.
<hr>



<b>Window Commands</b>   <!--   CONSIDER: WHICH OF THESE ARE GOOD CANDIDATES TO ADD TO THE TITLEBAR RIGHT-CLICK MENU (MenuCreator.cc)    -->
                                <!--       MaximizeHorizontal   and  MaximizeVertical                           -->
Window commands ordinarily affect only the currently focused window.
The <b>OnWindow</b> modifier and <b>ForEach</b> command may affect the window that is <!-- used -->targeted.

<b>Minimize</b> | <b>MinimizeWindow</b> | <b>Iconify</b>
        Minimize the current window, equivalent to the window button.  <!--  SHOULD ICONIFY HAVE A DIFFERENT BEHAVIOR _AND_ DESCRIPTION?   -->

<b>Maximize</b> | <b>MaximizeWindow</b>
        Maximize the current window, equivalent to the window button.

<b>MaximizeHorizontal</b> / <b>MaximizeVertical</b>
        Maximize the current window in one direction only, leaving the other dimension unchanged.

<b>Fullscreen</b>
        Resize the window’s content to fit the whole screen, without any window decoration.
        (when a keybind command targets an already fullscreen window, the command serves
        to toggle OFF "fullscreen" property of that window)
                       <!--      ^---v     supplemental, not mentioned in manpage  -->
        Note: while fullscreen, a window covers all components, even if they are set to a higher layer.
        (Yes, even the fluxbox toolbar. Yes, even if the toolbar has been set to "Auto raise".)

<b>Raise</b> / <b>Lower</b>
        Reorder this window to the top or bottom of the window stack, within its current layer.
        See <em>fluxbox(1)</em> for a discussion of layers.

<b>RaiseLayer</b> / <b>LowerLayer</b> [<em>offset</em>]
        Raise the window up to the layer above, or lower it to the layer below. See <em>fluxbox(1)</em> for a discussion of layers.

<b>SetLayer</b> <em>layer</em>
        Move the window to the specified layer. <em>layer</em> should be one of
        <b>AboveDock</b>, <b>Dock</b>, <b>Top</b>, <b>Normal</b>, <b>Bottom</b>, <b>Desktop</b>
        See <em>fluxbox(1)</em> for a discussion of layers.

<b>Close</b>
        Close the current window, equivalent to the window button.

<b>Kill</b> | <b>KillWindow</b>
        Close a window that’s not responding to <b>Close</b>, like using <b>xkill(1)</b>

<b>Shade</b> | <b>ShadeWindow</b>
        Toggle the <b>shaded</b> state of the current window, equivalent to the window button.
        A <b>shaded</b> window appears as only the title bar.

<b>ShadeOn</b> / <b>ShadeOff</b>
        Set the <b>shaded</b> state of the window to On / Off

<b>Stick</b> | <b>StickWindow</b>
        Toggle the <b>sticky</b> state of the current window, equivalent to the window button.
        A <b>sticky</b> window is visible on all workspaces.

<b>SetDecor</b> <em>decor</em>
        Sets which window decorations will be shown. <em>decor</em> has the same format
        as the ‘[Deco]’ parameter in the apps file. See <em>fluxbox-apps(5)</em> for more info.

<b>ToggleDecor</b>
        Toggles the presence of the window decorations (title bar, window buttons, and resize bar)

<b>NextTab</b> / <b>PrevTab</b>
        Cycle to the next / previous tab in the current tab group

<b>Tab</b> <em>number</em>
        Cycle to the given tab in the current tab group, where <b>1</b> is the first tab.
        A negative <em>number</em> counts from the end of the tab group
        (<b>-1</b> is the last tab, <b>-2</b> is the next-to-last, etc.)

<b>MoveTabRight</b> / <b>MoveTabLeft</b>
        Reorder the tabs in the current tab group, swapping the current tab with the one to the right / left.

<b>DetachClient</b>
        Remove the current tab from the tab group, placing it in its own window

<b>ResizeTo</b> <em>width[%]</em> <em>height[%]</em>
        Resizes the window to the given width and height.
        If the value is given in percent, the window size will be based on the current screen’s size.

<b>Resize</b> <em>delta-width[%]</em> <em>delta-height[%]</em>
        Resizes the window relative to the current width and height.
        If the value is given in percent, the window size will be based on the current window’s size.

<b>ResizeHorizontal</b> <em>delta-width[%]</em> / <b>ResizeVertical</b> <em>delta-height[%]</em>
        Resizes the window in one dimension only.
        If the value is given in percent, the window size will be based on the current window’s size.

<b>MoveTo</b> <em>x[%]</em> <em>y[%]</em> [<em>anchor</em>]
        Moves the window to the specified coordinates, given in pixels or relative to
        the current screen size if % is specified after the value.

        If either <em>x</em> or <em>y</em> is set to wildcard <b>*</b> that coordinate will be ignored,
        and the movement will only take place in one dimension.

        The default <em>anchor</em> is the upper left corner, but this may be overridden with one of:
            <b>TopLeft Left BottomLeft Top Center Bottom TopRight Right BottomRight</b>
<!--       SUPPLEMENTAL
		The syntax for the <b>MoveTo</b> command is
			:MoveTo [int|*] [int|*] [reference corner]

		The wildcard <b>*</b> means "use current value" and 'reference corner' is one of the following
			:* Left, Right
			:* Upper, UpperLeft, UpperRight
			:* Lower, LowerLeft, LowerRight
-->     Examples
          :MoveTo 0 * Left       -&gt; snap to left workspace edge
          :MoveTo * 0 Lower      -&gt; snap to lower workspace edge
          :MoveTo 0 0 UpperRight -&gt; snap to upper right workspace corner



<b>Move</b> <em>delta-x</em> <em>delta-y</em>
        Moves the window relative to its current position.
        Positive numbers refer to right and down, and negative to left and up, respectively.

<b>MoveRight</b> <em>d</em> / <b>MoveLeft</b> <em>d</em> / <b>MoveUp</b> <em>d</em> / <b>MoveDown</b> <em>d</em>
        Moves the window relative to its current position by the number of pixels specified in <em>d</em>.
        If the number is negative, it moves in the opposite direction.

<b>TakeToWorkspace</b> <em>workspace</em> / <b>SendToWorkspace</b> <em>workspace</em>
        Sends you along with the current window to the selected workspace.
        SendToWorkspace just sends the window. The first workspace is number <b>1</b>, not 0

<b>TakeToNextWorkspace</b> [<em>offset</em>] / <b>TakeToPrevWorkspace</b> [<em>offset</em>]
        Sends you along with the current window to the next or previous workspace.
        If you set <em>offset</em> to a value greater than the default of <b>1</b>, it will move you
        that number of workspaces ahead or behind.
        If you go beyond the end of the currently defined workspaces, it will wrap around to the other end automatically.

<b>SendToNextWorkspace</b> [<em>offset</em>] / <b>SendToPrevWorkspace</b> [<em>offset</em>]
        Identical to the "TakeTo..." commands, but again this sends only the window, and does not move you away from your current workspace.

<b>SetAlpha</b> [<em>alpha</em> [<em>unfocused-alpha</em>]]
    Sets the alpha value of a window.
    Putting a <b>+</b> or <b>-</b> in front of the value adds or subtracts from the current value.
    A plain integer sets the value explicitly.

    no arguments
        Resets both focused and unfocused settings to default opacity.

    one argument
        Changes both focused and unfocused alpha settings.

    two arguments
        First value becomes the focused alpha, second becomes the unfocused alpha value.

<b>SetHead</b> <em>number</em>
        Moves the window to the given display head. Only available when fluxbox has been compiled with Xinerama support.

<b>SendToNextHead</b> [<em>offset</em>] / <b>SendToPrevHead</b> [<em>offset</em>]
        Sends the current window to the next/previous display head. If you specify an <em>offset</em> greater than <b>1</b>,
        it will move the window that many heads. If this takes the window beyond the total number of heads, it
        will wrap around to the beginning.

<b>SetXProp</b> <em>PROP=value</em>
        Sets the xproperty <em>PROP</em> of the current window to <em>value</em>.
        Delete the content of <em>PROP</em> by using <em>PROP=</em>.

        Example usage:
        Apply (or delete) a 'tag' with "SetXProp TAG1=yes", then use the client pattern mechanism
        to match such 'tagged' windows, eg. "NextWindow@TAG1=yes)"
        SEE "@XPROP" LATER IN THIS DOCUMENT ("CLIENT PATTERNS" SECTION)

<hr>



<b>Workspace Commands</b>
<b><i>Workspace commands affect the entire workspace (or "desktop" as it is sometimes called).</i></b>

<b>AddWorkspace</b> / <b>RemoveLastWorkspace</b>
        Adds or removes a workspace from the end of the list of workspaces

<b>NextWorkspace</b> [<em>n</em>] / <b>PrevWorkspace</b> [<em>n</em>] / <b>RightWorkspace</b> [<em>n</em>] / <b>LeftWorkspace</b> [<em>n</em>]

        Switch to the Next / Previous workspace. All versions accept an offset value <em>n</em>, which defaults to <b>1</b>
        and refers to the number of workspaces to move at one time. {Next,Prev}Workspace wrap around when
        going past the last workspace, whereas {Right,Left}Workspace do not.
        The special offset "0" will toggle the former workspace for  NextWorkspace  and  PrevWorkspace

<b>Workspace</b> <em>number</em>
        Jumps to the given workspace <em>number</em>. The first workspace is <b>1</b>.

<b>NextWindow</b> [{<em>options</em>}] [<em>pattern</em>] / <b>PrevWindow</b> [{<em>options</em>}] [<em>pattern</em>]
    Focuses the next / previous window in the focus list.

    <em>options</em> is one or more of the following, space delimited:

    <b>static</b>
          Instead of moving in order of most-recent focus, move in order of when the window was opened
          (or, the order shown in the iconbar).

    <b>groups</b>
          Only include the current tab in windows with multiple tabs.
<!--             SUPPLEMENTAL (MAY BE OUTDATED)
    <b>PrevWindow</b> / <b>NextWindow</b> parameters take a bitmask:

        :* 0 or unspecified = Default/current behavior - no skipping
        :* 1 cycle groups
        :* 2 skip stuck windows
        :* 4 skip shaded windows

        :* 8 cycle linear (use the same order every time) For example, the following
             will skip any window which is stuck, or shaded, because 6 = 4 + 2.

               Mod1 tab :NextWindow 6
        Configuration file version 13 (look for "FBCV13" in your keys file) requires this syntax.

        This example cycles through all windows on the current workspace (and current head your mouse is on):
               Mod1 Tab :NextWindow (workspace=[current]) (head=[mouse])
-->

    If <em>pattern</em> arguments are supplied, only windows that match all the patterns are considered - all others are skipped.
    See the section <b>CLIENT PATTERNS</b> below for more information.

This pair of commands has a special side-effect when the keybinding used has a modifier - It will temporarily raise
the cycled window to the front so you can see it, but if you continue holding down the modifier and press the key again
(For example, keep holding "Alt" while you tap the "Tab" key a few times),
fluxbox will lower the window again when you move onward to the next one.
This allows you to preview the windows in order, but does not change the order in doing so.

<b>NextGroup</b> [{<em>options</em>}] [<em>pattern</em>] / <b>PrevGroup</b> [{<em>options</em>}] [<em>pattern</em>]
        Equivalent to NextWindow / PrevWindow above, but with the <b>groups</b> option forced on.

<b>GotoWindow</b> <em>number</em> [{<em>options</em>}] [<em>pattern</em>]
        Focuses and activates the window at position <em>number</em> in the focus list.
        The <em>options</em> and <em>pattern</em> arguments have the same meaning as <b>NextWindow</b> above.

<b>Activate</b> [<em>pattern</em>] | <b>Focus</b> [<em>pattern</em>]
        With <em>pattern</em>, this is an alias for <b>GoToWindow</b> 1 <em>pattern</em>. Without,
        this behaves like a window command, so that OnWindow events can change the focused window.

<b>Attach</b> <em>pattern</em>
        Combines all windows that match the <em>pattern</em> into a single tab group.
        See <b>CLIENT PATTERNS</b> for more about the <em>pattern</em> arguments.

<b>FocusLeft</b> / <b>FocusRight</b> / <b>FocusUp</b> / <b>FocusDown</b>
        Focus to the next window which is located in the direction specified.

<b>ArrangeWindows</b> <em>pattern</em> / <b>ArrangeWindowsVertical</b> <em>pattern</em> / <b>ArrangeWindowsHorizontal</b> <em>pattern</em>
        Tries to arrange all windows on the current workspace so that they overlap the least amount possible.
        <b>ArrangeWindowsVertical</b> prefers vertical splits (windows side by side), whereas <b>ArrangeWindowsHorizontal</b> prefers
        horizontal splits (windows on top of eachother). See <b>CLIENT PATTERNS</b> for more about the <em>pattern</em> arguments.

<b>ArrangeWindowsStackLeft</b> <em>pattern</em> / <b>ArrangeWindowsStackRight</b> <em>pattern</em>
    Similar to <b>ArrangeWindows</b>, these commands (re)arrange windows on the current workspace.
    The currently focused window is used as the <em>main</em> window, and will fill half the screen,
    while the other windows are tiled on the other half of the screen as if they were tiled with ArrangeWindows.

    <b>ArrangeWindowsStackLeft</b> puts the main window on the RIGHT hand side of the screen,
    and the tiled windows are on the LEFT hand side of the screen.

    <b>ArrangeWindowsStackRight</b> puts the main window on the LEFT hand side of the screen,
    and the tiled windows are on the RIGHT hand side of the screen.

<b>ArrangeWindowsStackTop</b> <em>pattern</em> / <b>ArrangeWindowsStackBottom</b> <em>pattern</em>
    Behaves just like <b>ArrangeWindowsStackLeft</b> and <b>ArrangeWindowsStackRight</b>.

<b>ArrangeWindowsStackBottom</b> places the main window on the TOP half of the screen,
and the tiled windows on the bottom half of the screen.

<b>ArrangeWindowsStackTop</b> places the main window on the BOTTOM half of the screen,
and the tiled windows on the top half of the screen.

<b>Unclutter</b> <em>pattern</em>         <!--       RECENTLY ADDED       -->
Arrange all matching windows to reduce the overall window overlap as much as possible. Windows are not resized.
See *CLIENT PATTERNS* for more about the 'pattern' arguments.

<b>ShowDesktop</b>
    Minimizes all windows on the current workspace. If they are already all minimized, then it restores them.

<b>ToggleSlitAbove</b>        <!--       RECENTLY ADDED       -->
    Toggles the slit between its regular and the AboveDock layer

<b>ToggleSlitHidden</b>        <!--       RECENTLY ADDED       -->
    Toggles the slit's autohiding state (autohide doesn't have to be enabled)

<b>ToggleToolbarAbove</b>        <!--       RECENTLY ADDED       -->
    Toggles the toolbar between its regular and the AboveDock layer
    (ie. above everything, even visible on active fullscreen windows)

<B>ToggleToolbarHidden</B>        <!--       RECENTLY ADDED       -->
    Toggles the toolbar's autohiding state (autohide doesn't have to be enabled)


<b>Deiconify</b> <em>mode</em> <em>destination</em>       <!--   skidoo   BUGGED: may not preserve stacking order of transient windows -->
    Deiconifies windows (or, restores from a minimized state)
    Where <em>mode</em> may be one of:

        <b>All</b>
            All icons across all workspaces

        <b>AllWorkspace</b>
            All icons on the current workspace

        <b>Last</b>
            The last icon across all workspaces

        <b>LastWorkspace</b> (default)
            The last icon on the current workspace

    And <em>destination</em> may be one of:
        <b>Current</b> (default)
            Deiconify to the current workspace

////// TODO: Leave this out until it is stable!     AS FOUND IN MANPAGE SOURCE -- DUNNO WHETHER THE FEATURE IS NOW "STABLE"
//////  <b>Origin</b>
//////      Deiconify to the window's original workspace, and moves you there.... sometimes?

        <b>OriginQuiet</b>
            Deiconify to the window’s original workspace, but does so in the background, without moving you there.

<b>SetWorkspaceName</b> <em>name</em> / <b>SetWorkspaceNameDialog</b>
    Sets the name of the current workspace

<b>CloseAllWindows</b>
    Closes all windows on all desktops
<hr>



<b>Menu Commands</b>
<b><i>Menu commands open or close fluxbox popup menus.
For more information on What these menus contain or how to configure them, see</i> fluxbox(1)</b>

<b>RootMenu</b>
        Opens the root menu. See <b>ROOT MENU</b> in <b>fluxbox-menu(5)</b> for details

<b>WorkspaceMenu</b>
        Opens a menu showing all workspaces and windows. See <b>Workspace Menu</b> in <b>fluxbox(1)</b> for details

<b>WindowMenu</b>
        Opens a menu containing actions for the current window. See <b>WINDOW MENU</b> in <b>fluxbox-menu(5)</b> for details

<b>ClientMenu</b> [<em>pattern</em>]
        Opens a menu that contains all windows. If you specify a <em>pattern</em>, only matching windows will be in the menu.
        Selecting a window will jump to that workspace and raise the window.
        See <b>CLIENT PATTERNS</b> below for more details on the <em>pattern</em> argument.

<b>CustomMenu</b> <em>path</em>
        Opens a custom menu file.
        This <em>path</em> must be a valid menu file in the same format as detailed by the <b>ROOT MENU</b> section of <b>fluxbox-menu(5)</b>

<b>HideMenus</b>
        Hide all fluxbox popup menus
<hr>



<b>Window Manager Commands</b>
<b><i>Window manager commands affect the Window Manager, or more than one window.</i></b>

<b>Restart</b> [<em>path</em>]
        Restarts fluxbox. This does not close any running applications.
        If the optional <em>path</em> is a path to an executable window manager, that manager is started in place of fluxbox.

<b>Quit</b> | <b>Exit</b>
        Exits fluxbox. This will normally cause X to stop as well and terminate all existing applications,
        returning you to the login manager or console.

<b>Reconfig</b> | <b>Reconfigure</b>
        Reloads all fluxbox configuration files including the keys file, apps file, and init file, if they have changed.

<b>SetStyle</b> <em>path</em>
        Sets the current style to that given in <em>path</em>, which must be the full path to a fluxbox style.

<b>ReloadStyle</b>
        Reloads only the current style. Useful after editing a style which is currently in use.

<b>ExecCommand</b> <em>args ...</em> | <b>Exec</b> <em>args ...</em> | <b>Execute</b> <em>args ...</em>

        Probably the most-used binding of all.
        Passes all the arguments to your <b>$SHELL</b> (or /bin/sh if $SHELL is not set).
        You can use this to launch applications, run shell scripts, etc.
        Since all arguments are passed verbatim to the shell, you can use environment variables,
        pipes, or anything else the shell can do. Note that processes only
        see environment variables that were set before fluxbox started (such as in <b>~/.fluxbox/startup</b>),
        or any that are set via the <b>Export</b> or <b>SetEnv</b> commands, below.
        See <b>fluxbox(1)</b> for more details on the <b>ENVIRONMENT</b> and <b>\~/.fluxbox/startup</b> file.

<b>CommandDialog</b>
        Pops up a dialog box that lets you type in any of these commands manually.
        THESE ~= ANY FLUXBOX COMMAND(S)?

<b>SetEnv</b> <em>name</em> <em>value</em> | <b>Export</b> <em>name</em>=<em>value</em>
        Sets an environment variable in Fluxbox.
        It will be passed to any applications spawned by any future ExecCommand commands.

<b>SetResourceValue</b> <em>resourcename</em> <em>resourcevalue</em> | <b>SetResourceValueDialog</b>
        Sets or changes a fluxbox resource value within the init file.
        See <em>fluxbox(1)</em> for more details on available resources and allowed values.
        <!--  TESTED.  USABILITY NIGHTMARE... AND BUGGY
              Set a keybind      Control F1: CommandDialog

              type    session.screen0.antialias  false  (and press enter)
              note that the ~/.fluxbox/init file is touched (Reconfigure automatically occurred?) but its content remains unchanged
                      i.e.   find/verify the line       session.screen0.antialias:true

              WHICHALL  "available resources and allowed values"  ???

              I've changed the default width (TextDialog.cc) from 200 to 540
              (CommandDialog instantiates TextDialog, and TextDialog does not accept a "width" parameter)
              but don't care to further wrestle with this probably useless "SetResourceValue (via dialog)" feature

         -->

<!--
<b>Toggle and SetResourceValue have nice possibilities of changing boolean values in the init file.</b>
However, a change to the resource values requires a reconfigure for them to take effect.
Unfortunately, reconfiguring within a toggle command resets the toggle command, meaning you'll never make it to the 'second' toggle.
This 'feature' may get fixed in an upcoming SVN/GIT release.
Workaround this by binding two separate keys:

    #Hide/Show toolbar with 2 macro commands until Toggle/Reconfigure bug/feature is fixed
    Mod4 comma               :MacroCmd {SetResourceValue session.screen0.toolbar.visible false} {Reconfigure}
    Mod4 period              :MacroCmd {SetResourceValue session.screen0.toolbar.visible true} {Reconfigure}
-->


<b>RelabelButton</b> <em>buttonname</em> <em>newlabelstring</em>
    dynamically changes the label of a button (e.g to reflect the $USER in a
    session menu button, the number of unread emails, etc) example usage:
    "fluxbox-remote RelabelButton button.foo $LABEL"
<hr>



<b>Special Commands</b>
<b><i>The following commands have special meanings or behaviors.</i></b>

<b>MacroCmd</b> {<em>command1</em>} {<em>command2</em>} {<em>command3</em>} <em>...</em>
        Enables you to execute more than one command with one keybinding.
        The commands will be executed in series.
        The <b>{</b> <b>}</b> brackets are literally required, as in the following example:
            MacroCmd {MoveTo 0 0} {ResizeTo 1280 800}

        The commands will be executed in the order they are supplied, and can be
        either <b>Exec[Command]</b> or internal commands such as <b>ShowDesktop</b>


<b>Delay</b> {<em>command</em>} [<em>microseconds</em>]
        Delays running <em>command</em> for the given amount of time.
        If the same key binding is activated again, the timer will be restarted.

<b>ToggleCmd</b> {<em>command1</em>} {<em>command2</em>} <em>...</em>
        Alternates between the commands. On the first press of the bound key, runs <em>command1</em>.
        On the next press, runs <em>command2</em>.

        Example (minimize all windows, and then bring them back):
            Mod4 m :ToggleCmd {ShowDesktop} {DeIconify all originquiet}
            <!--   skidoo  Are we gonna place a toolbar button for this? Ah, label only, no icon. HOWABOUTA unicode glyph    -->

<b>BindKey</b> <em>keybinding</em>
        Adds the given <em>keybinding</em> (which must be a valid key binding as defined in the DESCRIPTION
        section above) to your keys file, on-the-fly.
<!--             SUPPLEMENTAL (MAY BE OUTDATED)

    <b>BindKey</b> will append key string and action to your keys file and bind the key.
    A delta value means the difference between the current setting and the requested setting.
    Assume your window 100 is pixels wide.

     This keybind would increase the size of your window to 110 pixels
              Mod1 r :ResizeHorizontal 10

     The following keybind would decrease the size by 10, setting it to 90 pixels
              Mod1 R :ResizeHorizontal -10
-->


<b>KeyMode</b> <em>keymode</em> [<em>return-keybinding</em>]
        Activates the named <em>keymode</em> (or, all key binding lines prefaced with the same <em>keymode</em>:)
        and deactivates all others until the <em>return-keybinding</em> (by default <b>Escape</b>) is pressed.
        The default keymode is named <em>default</em>.

<b>ForEach</b> {<em>command</em>} [{<em>condition</em>}] | <b>Map</b> {<em>command</em>} [{<em>condition</em>}]
        Runs the given <em>command</em> (normally one from the <b>Window Commands</b> section above) on each window.
        If you specify a <em>condition</em> (See <b>Conditions</b>, below) the action will be limited to matching windows.

<b>If</b> {<em>condition</em>} {<em>then-command</em>} [{<em>else-command</em>}] | <b>Cond</b>  {<em>condition</em>} {<em>then-command</em>} [{<em>else-command</em>}]
        If the <em>condition</em> command returns <b>true</b>, then run the <em>then-command</em>,
        otherwise run the optional <em>else-command</em>.
        See <b>Conditions</b> below for more information on the <em>condition</em> argument.

        <b>Conditions</b>
        These special commands are used to match windows conditionally.
        They are commonly used by the <b>If</b> and <b>ForEach</b> command.

            <b>Matches</b> <em>pattern</em>
                Returns <b>true</b> if the current window matches the given <em>pattern</em>.
                See <b>CLIENT PATTERNS</b> below for details on the <em>pattern</em> syntax.

                If your key binding uses the <b>OnWindow</b> modifier, it matches against the window
                you clicked, not the currently focused window.

                To check other windows besides the currently focused one,
                see the <b>Every</b> and <b>Some</b> conditions below.

            <b>Some</b> <em>condition</em>
                Returns <b>true</b> if any window on any workspace
                (not just the currently focused one) matches the <em>condition</em>

            <b>Every</b> <em>condition</em>
                Returns <b>true</b> if every window on every workspace
                (not just the current one) matches the <em>condition</em>

            <b>Not</b> <em>condition</em>
                Returns <b>true</b> if <em>condition</em> returns <b>false</b>, and vice-versa.

            <b>And</b> {<em>condition1</em>} {<em>condition2</em>} [{<em>condition3</em>} ...]
                Returns <b>true</b> if and only if all given conditions return <b>true</b>

            <b>Or</b> {<em>condition1</em>} {<em>condition2</em>} [{<em>condition3</em>} ...]
                Returns <b>true</b> if any of the listed conditions return <b>true</b>

            <b>Xor</b> {<em>condition1</em>} {<em>condition2</em>} [{<em>condition3</em>} ...]
                Returns the boolean <b>xor</b> of the truth values for all conditions listed.
<hr>

<b>CLIENT PATTERNS</b>
Many of the more advanced commands take a <em>pattern</em> argument, which allows you to direct the action
at a specific window or set of windows which match the properties specified in the <em>pattern</em>.

A <em>pattern</em> looks like this

    <b>(</b>[<em>propertyname</em>[!]=]<em>regexp</em><b>)</b> ...

Match definitions are enclosed in parentheses <b>(</b>...<b>)</b>, and if no <em>propertyname</em> is given
then <b>Name</b> is assumed. The <em>regexp</em> can contain any regular expression, or the special value <b>[current]</b>,
which matches the corresponding value of the currently focused window.
See <em>regex(7)</em> for more information on acceptable regular expressions.

<em>propertyname</em> is not case sensitive, whereas the <em>regexp</em> is.

If you specify multiple <b>(<em>pattern</em></b>) arguments, this implies an AND condition -
All specified patterns must match.

You can use <b>=</b> to test for equality or <b>!=</b> to test for inequality.

The following values are accepted for <em>propertyname</em>
<div style="border: solid 1px black; padding: 8px; margin-left: 16px;">
<b>Name</b>
    A string, corresponding to the CLASSNAME property
    (The first field of WM_CLASS from the output of the <b>xprop(1)</b> utility)

<b>Class</b>
    A string, corresponding to the CLASSCLASS property
    (The second field of WM_CLASS from the output of the <b>xprop(1)</b> utility)

<b>Title</b>
    A string, corresponding to the window title (WM_NAME from <b>xprop(1)</b>)

<b>Role</b>
    A string, corresponding to the ROLE property (WM_WINDOW_ROLE from <b>xprop(1)</b>)

<b>Transient</b>
    Either <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b>, depending on whether the window is transient (typically, a popup dialog) or not

<b>Maximized</b>
    Either <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b>, depending on whether the window is maximized or not

<b>MaximizedHorizontal</b>
    Either <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b>, depending on whether the window is maximized horizontally or not

<b>MaximizedVertical</b>
    Either <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b>, depending on whether the window is maximized vertically or not

<b>Minimized</b>
    Either <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b>, depending on whether the window is minimized (iconified) or not

<b>Fullscreen</b>
    Either <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b>, depending on whether the window is fullscreen or not

<b>Shaded</b>
    Either <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b>, depending on whether the window is shaded or not

<b>Stuck</b>
    Either <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b>, depending on whether the window is sticky (on all workspaces) or not

<b>FocusHidden</b>
    Either <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b>, depending on whether the window has asked to be
    left off the focus list (or, the alt-tab list), or not.

<b>IconHidden</b>
    Either <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b>, depending on whether the window has asked to be
    left off the icon list (or, the taskbar), or not.

<b>Urgent</b>
    Either <b>yes</b> or <b>no</b>, depending on whether the window has the urgent hint set.

<b>Workspace</b>
    A number corresponding to the workspace number to which the window is attached.
    The first workspace here is <b>0</b>. You may also use <b>[current]</b> to match the currently visible workspace.

<b>WorkspaceName</b>
    A string corresponding to the name of the workspace to which the window is attached.

<b>Head</b>
    The number of the display head to which the window is attached.
    You may match this against the special value <b>[mouse]</b> which refers to the head where the mouse pointer currently resides.

<b>Layer</b>
    The string name of the window’s layer, which is one of
    <b>AboveDock</b>, <b>Dock</b>, <b>Top</b>, <b>Normal</b>, <b>Bottom</b>, <b>Desktop</b>

<b>Screen</b>
    The number of the currently used <em>screen</em>.
    If the setup of the running xserver involves independent screens (<em>not Xinerama</em>),
    the $DISPLAY environment contains something like <em>:0.1</em> or <em>:1.0</em>.
    The part after the dot (<em>.</em>) is the number of the screen.

<b>@XPROP</b>
    A string, corresponding to any xproperty (Use either the <b>xprop(1)</b> utility
    or the <em>SetXProp</em> command to set a xproperty to a window)

    Matches any windows with the CLASSNAME of "xterm"
        (xterm)

    Matches any windows with the same CLASSNAME as the currently focused window
        (Name=[current])

    Matches any windows on the same head as the mouse but on a different layer than the currently focused window
        (Head=[mouse]) (Layer!=[current])

    Matches any windows having a xproperty named FOO with "bar" in it
        (@FOO=.*bar.*)
</div>
<hr>
<b>FILES</b>
    <b>~/.fluxbox/keys</b>
        This is the default location for the keybinding definitions

    <b>/usr/X11R6/include/X11/keysymdef.h</b>
        X key names are in this file.

    <b>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/XKeysymDB</b>
        X key names are also in this file.
<hr>
<b>RESOURCES</b>

    <b>session.keyFile:</b> <em>location</em>
        This may be set to override the location of the keybinding definitions.
<hr>
<b>ENVIRONMENT</b>

Remember that <b>ExecCommand</b> command can take advantage of other environment
variables if they are set before fluxbox is started, or via the <b>Export</b> or
<b>SetEnv</b> commands. For example, if <b>$TERM</b> is set, it could be use like this:
    Mod1 x :ExecCommand $TERM
For more information about environment variables, see your shell’s manual.
<hr>

<b>EXAMPLES</b>
Here are a few interesting and/or useful examples you can do with your keys file.

# Mod4+drag moves a window
OnWindow Mod4 Mouse1 :StartMoving

# If any xterm windows are open, cycle through them. If none are open, open one:
Mod4 t :If {Some Matches (xterm)} {NextWindow (xterm)} {Exec xterm}

# Set a different wallpaper on every workspace:
ChangeWorkspace :Exec fbsetbg ~/.fluxbox/bg$(xprop -root _NET_CURRENT_DESKTOP | awk '{print $3}').png

# Focuses the next window with it's xproperty 'PROP' set to 'foo'
Mod4 p Mod4 Tab :NextWindow (@PROP=foo)

<h1>KeyModes</h1>

<h2>What are KeyModes?</h2>

<p>KeyModes are a way to create modes or "namespaces" within the keybindings of Fluxbox.
They create a context for Fluxbox's keybindings and can be used in any way you see fit to make Fluxbox behave
 the way you want it to. The most common use for KeyModes is window resizing and movement.</p>

<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
Mod4 Shift Up        :ResizeVertical -2
Mod4 Shift Down      :ResizeVertical +2
Mod4 Shift Left      :ResizeHorizontal -2
Mod4 Shift Right     :ResizeHorizontal +2
Mod1 Shift Up        :ResizeVertical -10
Mod1 Shift Down      :ResizeVertical +10
Mod1 Shift Left      :ResizeHorizontal -10
Mod1 Shift Right     :ResizeHorizontal +10</pre>

<p>As you can see, you run out of <em>usable</em> hotkeys for actions like that pretty quickly.
 KeyModes alleviate this "namespace clutter" and provide an elegant solution for this use-case.</p>

<h2>How do I use KeyModes?</h2>

<p>You'll use the syntax below, inside   ~/.fluxbox/keys<br>
:</p>
<pre>[KeyMode:] [mod mod] key [key key] :command command-options</pre>

<p>If you don't define a KeyMode, the <em>default</em> KeyMode is used instead. To use a mapping inside a KeyMode, use the <b>KeyMode</b> prefix at the beginning of your definition:</p>
<pre>:KeyMode ModeName [mod [mod mod ...] key [key key ...]]</pre>

<p>The last   <code>mod...key</code>
 combination is used to get back into the default KeyMode. If this is not defined, the default is bound to <kbd>Esc</kbd>.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>Here are a few examples of resizing and moving windows that someone might want to add to their   <i>keys</i> file.</p>

<h3>Resizing windows, exiting with <kbd>Esc</kbd></h3>
<pre># ResizeMode
Mod4 w Mod4 r               :KeyMode ResizeMode
ResizeMode: None Up         :ResizeVertical -2
ResizeMode: None Down       :ResizeVertical +2
ResizeMode: None Left       :ResizeHorizontal -2
ResizeMode: None Right      :ResizeHorizontal +2
ResizeMode: Shift Up        :ResizeVertical -10
ResizeMode: Shift Down      :ResizeVertical +10
ResizeMode: Shift Left      :ResizeHorizontal -10
ResizeMode: Shift Right     :ResizeHorizontal +10</pre>

<h3>Moving windows, exiting with <i>Esc</i></h3>
<pre># MoveMode
Mod4 w Mod4 m               :KeyMode MoveMode
MoveMode: None Up           :MoveUp 2
MoveMode: None Down         :MoveDown 2
MoveMode: None Left         :MoveLeft 2
MoveMode: None Right        :MoveRight 2
MoveMode: Shift Up          :MoveUp 10
MoveMode: Shift Down        :MoveDown 10
MoveMode: Shift Left        :MoveLeft 10
MoveMode: Shift Right       :MoveRight 10</pre>

<h3>Disable all keybindings (e.g. using with Xnest)</h3>
<pre># XnestMode<br />Mod1 x      :KeyMode XnestMode</pre>

<h3>Mode Indicator</h3>

<p>This is a crude example of what you could use to provide an on-screen indicator that you've changed modes:</p>
<pre>      Mod4 w Mod4 r   :MacroCmd {Exec echo "Resize Mode&quot; | osd_cat -d 1 -p bottom -A center} {KeyMode ResizeMode}</pre>

<p>Other programs are also possible, such as   `inotify` or `xcowsay`</p>
</div>

<div style="width:720px; border:1px solid black; padding: 8px;">

<h2>What is Mod4</h2>

<p>Mod4 is the ``Windows`` key found on most keyboards. (Often 2 of 'em are present ~~ on each side of spacebar key).
On the left it is between Ctrl and Alt; on the right side next to AltGr. Then there is also the Menu on the right side, next to Ctrl.</p>

<h2>On an Apple/Mac</h2>
<p>On Apple keyboards, it is the Apple &quot;command&quot; key, found immediately to the left and right of the space bar.</p>

<h2>Mod key information</h2>
<p>It is possible to get information about which keys are assigned to which modifiers by running the command</p>
<pre>      $ xmodmap -pm</pre>

<p>A working Mod4 key will typically have the entry</p>
<pre>     mod4    Super_L</pre>

<h2>Setting up Mod4</h2>
<p>If mod4 is not assigned to a key, or you have updated to Modular X and now your mod4 key has quit working, try running the command</p>
<pre>      $ xmodmap -e 'add mod4 = Super_L'</pre>

<h2>Setting up Super_L</h2>
<p>If mod4 cannot be assigned, the Super_L keysym may not be assigned to a key on the keyboard. The `<i>xev</i>` command
 will display information when a key is pressed:</p>

<pre>KeyPress event, serial 34, synthetic NO, window 0x1e00001,
     root 0x13b, subw 0x0, time 16844797, (867,-539), root:(868,243),
     state 0x0, 
     <b>keycode 115 (keysym 0x0, NoSymbol)</b>  , same_screen YES,
     XLookupString gives 0 bytes: 
     XmbLookupString gives 0 bytes: 
     XFilterEvent returns: False</pre>

<p>If the state is set to <b>NoSymbol</b> then you can assign the key to Super_L by taking the keycode given (in this case 115)
 and running the command:</p>
<pre>    $ xmodmap -e 'keycode 115 = Super_L'</pre>

<h2>Storing xmodmap expressions</h2>
<pre>xmodmap expressions can be stored by adding the part between the single quotes to your <b>~/.Xmodmap</b> file.
Be sure that you add the line in your <a href="Editing_the_startup_file,html">startup</a> file, or your ~/.xinitrc file
       $ xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap
so that the expressions are loaded at startup.</pre>
</div>




<hr><hr><hr><div style="width:720px; border:1px solid red; padding-left: 18px;">
<pre>In case you encounter a 3rd-party utility called 'fluxkeys' which reputedly 'helps' build a keys file
<b>BEWARE -- don't use it!</b>  The fluxkeys program (is outdated and) will corrupt your keys file.
Notably, when fluxkeys saves your edited keyfile, it will:

   change bindings to read 'Mousetop1' 'Mousetop2', etc.
   (thereby disabling your ability to use your mouse properly)

   remove any comments and blank lines from your keys file.

   it may also (for unknown reasons) truncate the keys file.

   Also, any command which the outdated fluxkeys doesn't recognize
   (including keymodes, and custom menus) will be removed from your keys file.</pre></div>
