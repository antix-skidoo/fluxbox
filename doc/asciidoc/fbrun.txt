NAME
----
fbrun - displays a Run... dialogwindow (provided by "fluxbox" package)

SYNOPSIS
--------
*fbrun* ['options']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*fbrun(1)* is analagous to the ``Run...'' dialog in other desktop environments.
This means that it is an easy way to start a program which isn't contained
in the menu (or to pass a specific set of parameters during a given invocation).

Pressing ``Enter'' will close the window and execute the command in your present
*$SHELL*. Pressing ``Esc'' will close the window and does not execute anything.

Another fbrun usage is to call it from the menu with a preloaded  command line
(which you can edit and then execute. An example: sshing to a very long host name
with lots of options, each of which often requires changing.  In this case, you
could add an entry for fbrun to your menu that contains all the options  and  the
host name. When you use said entry, you could edit the line as necessary and execute it.
