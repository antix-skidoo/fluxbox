Changes for 1.3.8-ski

*2017/05/13:
    * Rollup: incorporates patches and cherrypicked pull requests which
      are absent from both the official 1 .3 .7 tree at github and
      the 1 .3 .7 debian eXpErImEnTaL package. Also merges select patches
      which had been submitted to fluxbox project tracker as sourceforge

    * fluxbox-update_configs.cc
      During testing, i noticed that with each re-install, the mechanism
      was blindly, redundantly, postpending (and thereby "breaking") matched lines.
      So, currently,
       BLINDLY INJECTS REDUNDANT COPIES EACH TIME FLUXBOX IS (RE)INSTALLED !

    * removed upstream's file "TODO" from top-level of the source tree.
      It contained "maybe someday" items which were penned years ago, were
      never fulfilled, and mentioned ideas I'm not inclined to pursue.

    * a clarification (not a change): as built for debian (antiX), the installer
      removes the "fluxbox-generate_menu" utility; we use a different
      mechanism to auto-update the menus.

    * v------ clarification + notes regarding "new in 1.3.7" changes-------v
      Add -no-slit and -no-toolbar flags
       " Sometimes fluxbox is used as a component of a desktop environment (e.g., the "Lumina Desktop").
         It's easier and more stable for such implementations to disable the toolbar or the slit altogether. "
    * new SpacerTool
    * allow generic buttons to be used in toolbar
      - *.toolbar.tools: button.foo, iconbar, ...
      - *.toolbar.button.foo.label: F
      - *.toolbar.button.foo.commands: RootMenu:Exec foo
    * allow to change a button label  via fluxbox-remote =====================
      (example usage: update the unread mail counter)
    * support autoraising of Slit / Toolbar
    * new actions "ToggleSlitHidden", "ToggleToolbarHidden"
    * new statements to the apps-file:
      - FocusProtection (None, Lock, Deny)
    * new flags for fbrun:
      - add -autocomplete flag
      - add -cf <completion-data>
    * Allow to decorate the title of iconified (minimized) windows in the iconbar
    * new actions "ToggleSlitHidden", "ToggleToolbarHidden"           NOT YET DOCUMENTED
    * new SpacerTool toolbar element
    * allow generic buttons to be used in toolbar
        ( *.toolbar.tools: button.foo, iconbar, ... )
        ( *.toolbar.button.foo.label: F )
        ( *.toolbar.button.foo.commands: RootMenu:Exec foo )
    * allow changing a button label via fluxbox-remote
      Dynamically changes the label of a button (e.g to reflect the $USER in a
      session menu button, the number of unread emails, etc) example usage:
      "fluxbox-remote RelabelButton button.foo $LABEL"
    * support autoraising of Slit / Toolbar
    * new statements to the apps-file:        WOT?   DOCS STATE "DEPRECATED! Please use FocusProtection "Gain" or "Refuse" instead."
         FocusProtection (None, Lock, Deny)
    * new flags for fbrun:              NOT YET DOCUMENTED
         add -autocomplete flag
         add -cf <completion-data>


    *   =====        v----Changes for 1.4.0      http://git.fluxbox.org/fluxbox.git/commit/?h=prep/release-1.4.0
        * SOME OF THESE I HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED, ABOVE...    AND A FEW OF THESE I CHOSE NOT TO IMPLEMENT, PERIOD

    * 2016/11/05:
        * Boyscouting: Add stdc++11 helpers to build system
    * 2016/10/09:
        * Feature: prevent range overflow
    * 2016/10/02
        * Make preferredWidth max from un- and focused width
    * 2016-10-02
        * attempt a more fair container item squeezing (TOOLBAR)
    * 2016/09/24:
        * Optimization: compress resize signals
    * 2016/09/21:
        * Feature: show tooltips for tabs
        * Document generic toolbar buttons
        * button: export pressed state and assigned commands

    * 2016/09/18:
       * Bugfix fbrun: fix segfault upon expanding "~" or "."
       * Bugfix fbrun: escape special chars in filenames
    * 2016/09/14:
       * Feature: allow "onwinbutton", "onminbutton", "onmaxbutton" actions in keys             NOT DOCUMENTED YET
                               This allows to override the default behavior as well as adding actions for the mouse wheel.
                               Special casing of the two "geometry" related buttons (eg. to perform smart maximization,
                               reverse the partial maximzation, add shading to the min button or whatnot) All other buttons
                               have a rather dedicated meaning and are only really interesting for adding mouse wheels or eg.
                               the window menu on rmb clicks.
    * 2016/09/13:
       * Feature: allow tabs to be moved accross workspaces
       * Feature: add "onslit" actions ~~ make it raise on left-click (like the toolbar)
    * 2016/09/11:

           (now mentions RowMinOverlapPlacement, AutotabPlacement, ColMinOverlapPlacement)
       * Feature: add "autotabplacement"
          new Windows are automatically tabbed to the currently focused window
       * Do not break server grabs
       * std::auto_ptr to std::unique_ptr
    * 2016/09/01:
       * Bugfix: send ConfigureNotify events using root coordinates
       * Bugfix fluxbox-remote: fix bad "if"-test
    * 2016/09/06:
       * Improve UTF8 support: use std::iscntrl to avoid some conversions

       * Bugfix: hide menus upon clicking the title or toolbar (Closes #1149)
    * 2016/09/01:

       * Improvement: avoid placing a window in invisble places on a different head
       * Feature: add "Unclutter" command (Feature request #248) ==========================
           Arrange all matching windows to reduce the overall window overlap as much as possible. Windows are not resized.
           See *CLIENT PATTERNS* (man fluxbox-keys) for more about the 'pattern' arguments.
    * 2016/08/28:
       * Bugfix: fix "MoveX" actions
       * Bugfix: handle $DISPLAY containing ":x" and ":x.0" (Closes #1052)

       * Feature: support autoraising for Toolbar / Slit
       * Feature: indicate iconified windows in iconbar      =================== I REGARD THIS AS POTENTIALLY UNDESIRABLE.
          INSTEAD OF DISPLAYING AN ICON INTO THE TRAY, WINDOW TITLE IS DISPLAYED AS LABEL
          AND, UPON UN-ICONIFYING (TESTED GEANY FIND WINDOW) THE ITEM CONTINUES TO DISPLAY IN TRAY, UNTIL THE AFFECTED WINDOW IS CLOSED
    * 2016/08/12:
       * Feature: add actions "ToggleSlitAbove", "ToggleToolbarAbove" (Feature request #222)
       * Feature: support "IgnoreSizeHints" in ~/.fluxbox/apps (Closes #1075)
    * 2016/08/11:
       * Feature: support artificial structs (Feature request #150)
       * Improvement: grab Xserver to reduce exposure events on workspace change
    * 2016/08/03:
       * Improvement: delay rerendering of title updates to reduce X11 rendering stress ==========
           Notably shells will cause brief interim titles when calling short-lived commands (try "ls"...)
           This covers such by waiting 100ms after every title update before reacting
           (the title will have returned in the mentioned cases, the UI remains steady)
    * 2016/08/01:
       * Bugfix: handle oversized windows (Closes #688, #984)

    * 2016/07/24:
       * Feature: add SpacerTool toolbar item (Closes #1141) ========================= NOT YET DOCUMENTED. NEED TO TRY/CONFIRM
           a spacer item can be declared as fixed size or stretching. Examples:
              session.screen0.toolbar.spacer: RELATIVE
                 or
              session.screen0.toolbar.spacer_36: FIXED

*12/09/14:
    * Fixed regression: Use microseconds in DelayCmd
    * Bugfix: (re)setting timeouts on a running FbTk::Timber corrupts timer list
    * Added actions 'NearestCorner', 'NearestEdge', 'NearestCornerOrEdge'


*12/08/28:
    * Changed timer functions to use a monotonic increasing clock
      gettimeofday() is subject to be changed on daylight-saving or other
      ntp-related events (leap-seconds). It might also change back in time.
      clock_gettime()or mach_absolute_time() (on MacOSX) are monotonic
      increasing and do not change back in time. See FbTk::FbTime

*12/07/29:
    * Fix placement of transient Windows

      RefCount, FbTk::Timer, const Signals, Documentation fixes etc
    * Compilefix: build without 'iconv' support
    * Bugfix: sync the copied config files to the disk before continuing to
      launch. This avoids possible race conditions, eg. under MacOSX
    * Relicense 'ostrich' themeto please Debian / Ubuntu
    * Bugfix: Do not change workspaces when using NextWindow/PrevWindow in toolbar

*11/05/10:
    * Use the new signal system exclusively
      In 2010 Henrik introduced a new signal/slot system as a replacement
      to the observer/subject code. That transition was never completed
      Pavel cleaned up the missing parts, fixed some crashes related to restart() / shutdown of fluxbox

    * Better option for 'feh' when keeping aspect ration
    * Bugfix: possible crash if m_holder == 0

-----------------------------
Changes for 1.3.0

*11/02/19:
    * Readded default style to data/init
    * Allow to override 'Focus New Windows' via .fluxbox/apps
    * Bugfix: semantical difference between WinState::Decoration and Remember::save()
    * Added 'fontconfig' as link dependency if Xft is used
    * Added syntax / coloring for 'Vim' to '3rd/vim'
    * Bugfix: Prevent SIGFPE when using nxserver, closes #2813828
    * Bugfix: handle result of DisplayString() correctly, bug #3136775
      fluxbox assumed that the result of DisplayString() contains always the
      screen number. This is not the case in some newer versions of libX11
    * Bugfix: handle situation when DISPLAY is not set
    * Bugfix: use system() for launching 'fluxbox-update_configs'
      FbCommands::ExecuteCmd() was used before. This changes the config
      while fluxbox is loading (from the config), this caused some nasty
      effects on 'slower' systems. system() now blocks until
      'fluxbox-update_configs' is done and then launches flubox

*10/09/19:
    * Compile fix: fluxbox loves g++-4.1 again

*10/09/18:
    * Bugfix: redesigned bootstrapping
      The old bootstrap could lead to corrupt files. We now first
      bootstrap, then try to upgrade potentially old config files and
      after that we bring up flubox. This eliminates to signal USR2
      from 'fluxbox-update_configs' the current running fluxbox
      instance and retriggering bootstrapping and updating the config
      files which could again lead to resignal fluxbox

*10/09/17:
    * New command 'ArrangeWindowsVertical'
    * Bugfix: do use soon-to-be-dead pointers for putenv()
    * Bugfix: correct refcounting of the corner shapes
    * Bugfix: create corner pixmaps of FbTk::Shape only once per Screen
    * Bugfix: correctly free corner pixmaps of FbTk::Shape

*10/09/11:
    * Implemented simple tagging mechanism (skidoo sez: ???)
      Apply (or delete) a 'tag' with the new command "SetXProp TAG1=yes",
      then use the client pattern mechanism to match such 'tagged'
      windows, eg. "NextWindow (@TAG1=yes)"
    * Add '(workspace=[current])' to default keys-file
      Upgraded the config version to '13', also updated 'fluxbox-update_configs'
      to add '(workspace=[current])' to old '~/.fluxbox/keys' for lines
      having 'NextWindow/PrevWindow/NextGroup/PrevGroup'
    * Code cleanup for 'fluxbox-update_configs'
      Moved the code for each 'update step' into its own function

*10/09/10:
    * Do not limit cycleFocus() to windows on the current workspace
      This could be achieved by adding '(workspace=[current])' to the client pattern of the command anyway
      Closes #1732115: 'focus urgentchat windows on other workspaces'
    * Bugfix: 'Shape' of a menu was created before the parent window
    * Continue to clean up the code base, mostly by using FbTk::Util::clamp()
    * Introduced 'FbTk::BidiString' which holds both the logical content and
      the visual reordered version of the content of a string. this helps to
      reduce the number of calls to reorder the string before drawing it
      and to be more consistent in menus and textboxesdrawing cursors and underlining text

*10/09/05:
    * Added support for bidirectional text
    * Code deduplication and simplification
    * Added new action 'ActivateTab'
    * Added new focus model 'StrictMouseFocus'.  This will affect focus when ==========================
     closing, moving, lowering windows, changing desktops, etc, whereas the
     'MouseFocus' model will only change focus when you move the mouse.
      Similar to 'MouseFocus', but no mouse movement is required, ie. the window is also
      focused if it moves below the mouse, eg. because it shows up or you change the virtual desktop

   * Fixed placement bug of maximized windows when moved out of a xinerama screen

*10/04/30:
   * Bugfix: _NET_WM_STATE was not set correctly on 64bit systems
   * Changed title signal from Focusable to use the new signal system
   * Changed debug output to use fbdbg instead of cerr
   * Reduce clock update checks
   * Fixed spelling in documentation
   * Implemented new 'MoveN' and 'ClickN' support for keys file
   * Updated fluxbox-keys documentation, added 'Fullscreen'
   * Keep 'maximized/fullscreen' state when moving a window between heads window
   * Build system cleanup: Check for extension headers
   * Bugfix: fluxbox-update_configs wiped out keys file
   * Bugfix: Empty submenus lead to misfunction of the 'HideMenus' command
   * Implemented visibility of titlebar buttons via the apps file

*09/06/28:
   * Allow matching screen number in ClientPattern
   * Hide the menu when you click on a window
   * Make Raise/LowerLayer commands accept integer argument, default 2
   * Change default toolbar head to 1
   * Add window menu and alt-tab to error case for keys file
   * Revert to relative iconbar alignment when too many windows are open

*09/05/26:
   * Fixed unexpected window focus changes under "focus follows mouse"
   * Make fbsetbg quieter on '-z' if there's no lastwallpaper
   * Add new "background: unset" property for use in overlays
   * Key file parsing error for MacroCmd with unterminated {...} pairs
   * Many documentation updates:
     * Rewrote most manpages into asciidoc format
     * Split monolithic fluxbox(1) into fluxbox-apps(5), fluxbox-menu(5)
     * Renamed fluxstyle(1) to fluxbox-style(5)

*08/11/01:
   * Don't reload keys file when modifier map changes, just regrab
   * Don't allow resizing to negative dimensions
   * Ignore XRandr events that don't change the screen size
   * Merge menuDelay and menuDelayClose options in init
   * Allow relative paths for background images in style files

*08/10/05:
   * Remove menu modes
   * Remove follow models
   * Remove line style resources from init file
   * Remove rootcommand from init, as fbsetbg is run automatically nowadays
     For other purposes, use startup instead

*08/10/04:
   * Recognize --option in addition to -option for long option names
   * Add -print option to fbrun that sends the result to stdout instead of running it
   * Fix CustomMenu and ClientMenu commands from fluxbox-remote
   * Break emacs-style keychains after one invalid key has been pressed
   * Fix flickering of shaped windows, #2131548 and #2001027

*08/10/01:
   * Don't flash original window while cycling
   * Reset background when screen changes resolution
   * Restore missing config files on reconfigure

*08/09/28:
   * Changed resize signal, in screen, to use the new signal system
   * Changed workspace area signal to use the new signal system
   * Changed focused window signal to use the new signal system
   * Fixed issues with round corners on restart, #2110455

*08/09/21:
   * Changed signals 'icon list', 'client list', background changed',
    'workspace names', 'current workspace' signal in BScreen to use the new signal system
   * Fix crashes when analyzing bad constructed _NET_WM_ICON data
   * Changed workspace count signal in BScreen to use the new signal system
   * Added new Signal/Slot system to FbTk
     This is suppose to replace the obsolete Subject/Observer classes
   * Fix crash when using SetTitleDialog on a window that's been closed

-----------------------------
Changes for 1.1.1

*08/09/14:
   * Fixed a minor pixmap resource leak
   * Fixed unshading crash
   * Be aware of badly specified _NET_WM_ICONS
   * Added windowmenu to distpackage

-----------------------------
Changes for 1.1.0

*08/09/01:
   * When the current menu item gets disabled, highlight its nearest neighbor and add separators to the focus model menu

*08/08/22:
   * Remove borders from maximized windows
   * Add -sync command line option for debugging X issues
   * Added SendToNextHead and SendToPrevHead commands
   * Added SetDecor key command
   * Add new [transient] tag to apps file to match transient windows

*08/08/18:
   * Combined code for MoveTo key command and saved window positions
     Side effects:
     - both now have the following options: TopLeft Left BottomLeft Top Center
       Bottom TopRight Right BottomRight
     - the CENTER reference in apps now behaves like WINCENTER
     - some previously saved positions will be wrong, since they are now
       computed relative to the toolbar and slit
     - CENTER/WINCENTER will now work properly with Xinerama when placing the
       window on a head other than the top left one
   * Add Top Center, Left Center, Right Center, and Bottom Center tab placement options

*08/08/17:
   * Add new key commands SetTitle and SetTitleDialog
   * Created manual for fluxbox-remote
   * Automatically restore the previous background on startup

*08/08/05:
   * Fixed Focus key command
   * Added new SetLayer key command
   * Make ShowDesktop command toggle between showing windows and desktop
   * Created new `fluxbox-keys' man page
   * Make resize cursors consistent
   * Add selection box to various "choose one of these" menu items
   * Add window list argument to ArrangeWindows
   * Remove antiquated dithering code
   * Move default window menu to ~/.fluxbox/windowmenu
   * Add urgent=yes|no option to client patterns
   * Allow window menu items in ordinary menus
   * Leave titlebar and handle borders alone with borderless windows
   * Add -list-commands command line option, which prints a list of valid fluxbox commands

*08/05/13:
   * Only reload custom menus when necessary
   * Only reload the keys file if the contents have changed
   * Modifying the apps file no longer requires a reconfigure
   * Made tooltip in toolbar update when the title changes
   * Add tooltips for iconbar buttons
   * Minor changes for fluxbox-generate_menu
   * Notice when user replaces a non-existent menu file
   * Don't allow empty root menu
   * Added SimpleObserver class

*08/01/27:
   * Reload the Xinerama layout on RandR signal
   * Move windows out of inactive heads upon Xinerama layout change

*07/12/28:
   * Added new key command :Delay {<command>} [<int>], which runs the command
     after a delay of <int> microseconds (default is 200 milliseconds)
   * Removed KDE configure option, since it didn't do anything
   * Added resource session.screen<N>.slit.acceptKdeDockapps: <boolean>
   * Added new style items window.(un)focus.border{Width,Color}
   * Added new key command :StartTabbing

*07/12/20:
   * Added new key command :ForEach (or :Map)
     - :ForEach {<command>} [{ [{<list opts>}] [<bool command>] }]
     - For example, the following command will shade all windows on the current
       workspace: ForEach {shade} {{groups} Matches (workspace=[current])}
     - <list opts> can be any combination of `static' and `groups' where static
       means windows are listed in creation order, and groups means individual
       tabs are not considered separately
     - This replaces syntax such as `:Minimizelayer)', which no longer works

*07/12/19:
   * Don't let transient windows steal focus from other programs
   * Open transient windows on same workspace as parent
   * Holding control while clicking on a menu item will now keep the menu open
   * Fix startup items in apps file with specified screen number, bug #1843325
   * Fix compiling with gcc 4.3

*07/12/13:
   * Fix configure option --with-style
   * Close menus only when they lose focus
   * Moved command parsing code all over the place -- expect any patches that add new commands to be broken
   * Added new resize modes for key command StartResizing: NearestEdge, Left, Right, Top, Bottom
   * Only allow one menu to be open at a time

*07/12/09:
   * Added OnTitlebar and Double modifiers to the keys file for clicks on the
     titlebar and double clicks, respectively
     - For example, `OnTitlebar Double Mouse3 :Maximize' will maximize a window
       when you double click on the titlebar with the right mouse button
     - Note: if you have commands bound to both a single and double click, the
       single click command will still be executed on the first half of a double click
     - Added new key commands ShadeOn and ShadeOff that set whether or not a
       window is shaded, rather than toggling the current state

*07/11/22:
   * Added some new special keys to the keys file: FocusIn, FocusOut, MouseOver,
     MouseOut, ChangeWorkspace
     - FocusIn/FocusOut correspond to a window gaining or losing focus, e.g. the
       following will raise all xterms when one gains focus:
       FocusIn :If {(Matchesxterm)} {(Raisexterm)} {}
     - MouseOver/MouseOut correspond to the mouse moving over the window or
       toolbar (when used with OnToolbar) -- OnDesktop not yet supported, e.g.
       the following will unshade a window when you move your mouse over it with
       alt pressed:
       Mod1 MouseOver :If {Matches (shaded=yes)} {Shade} {}
     - ChangeWorkspace corresponds to the workspace being changed, e.g. the
       following will set a different wallpaper for each workspace:
       ChangeWorkspace :Exec fbsetbg ~/.fluxbox/bg$(xprop -root _NET_CURRENT_DESKTOP | awk '{print $3}').png
   * Fix division by 0 error when resize increments are set to 0 by an application, bug #1836182
   * Added conditional statements to key commands
     - for example, this will search for an open xterm window, cycle through
       them if there are any, or else open one:
       Mod4 t :If {Some Matches(xterm)} {NextWindow(xterm)} {Exec xterm}
     - the syntax is :If {<test>} {<command if true>} {<command if false>}
     - `Matches <pattern>' is currently the only test you can make; when used
       alone, it tests the focused window or the clicked window for OnWindow
       mouse events
     - there are many ways to combine tests:
       - `Some <test>' returns true if any open client matches <test>
       - `Every <test>' returns true if every open client matches <test>
       - `Not <test>' negates the value of <test>
       - `Or {<test>} {<test>} ...' returns true if any of the tests is true
       - `And {<test>} {<test>} ...' returns true if all of the tests are true
       - `Xor {<test>} {<test>} ...' returns the boolean xor of the truth values

*07/11/16:
   * Added new key command :Focus [<pattern>] that focuses a window e.g., using OnWindow or specified using a window pattern
   * Using ToggleDecor from Deco=TAB should hide tabs
   * Allow arbitrary window patterns for the iconbar mode
     - Note: for now, if you match against the current head of a window, it will not be updated as expected in the toolbar
   * Fix crash when cycling focus and window closes, bug #1787345
   * Update autoraise delay on reconfigure
   * Move fullscreen windows to normal layer when they lose focus
   * Fixed some gcc 2.96 compile issues
   * Introducedworkspacename=... for pattern matching and changed workspace=... to use the workspace number, indexed from 0
   * Reenabled raising window if window was moved by mouse by 0 pixels

*07/10/23:
   * Adding/removing workspaces wasn't updating menu
   * Support remembering maximized, minimized, and fullscreen state
     - [Maximized] {yes|no|horz|vert}
     - [Minimized] {yes|no}
     - [Fullscreen] {yes|no}
     - also fixed window placement when remembering head but not position
   * Allow negated patterns, e.g.name!=xterm

*07/10/22:
   * Added option "mouse" to client pattern
     This is useful for xinerama. For example:
     Mod1 Tab :NextWindowhead=[mouse]
     This will cycle focus through windows that are on the same head as the mouse pointer
   * Fixed crash bug at restart.
   * Replaced modKey with new commands StartMoving and StartResizing
     - your keys file should be updated automatically
     - they must be used with a mouse button, or they won't work
     - StartResizing takes one or none of the following arguments:
       NearestCorner, Center, TopLeft, TopRight, BottomLeft, BottomRight

*07/10/21:
   * Allow decorations bitmask to be specified using '0x'
   * Fixed gcc 2.96 compile problem (bug #1809786)
   * Added OnWindow modifier to keys file
   * Added support for transient windows in window patterns, (e.g.
    transient=yes|no), defaulting to "no" for the apps file
   * Bugfix for SendToPrevWorkspace/TakeToPrevWorkspace
   * Merged pre-devel branch; see all Changes since 1.0.0
   * deiconify windows via :Deiconify in reverse order
   * Added key command :Attach <pattern> which groups all windows matching the given pattern
   * Added resources session.screen<N>.maxDisable{Move,Resize}: <boolean>, which
     prevent maximized windows from being moved/resized

*07/05/19:
   * Changed behavior of resource session.screen<N>.followModel
     - now only options are Ignore and Follow, the latter using the setting in session.screen<N>.userFollowModel
   * Added new resource session.screen<N>.noFocusWhileTypingDelay: <int>
     - specifies a time in milliseconds that new windows should not gain focus
       while the user is typing in the focused window
   * Added new placement policies {Row,Col}MinOverlapPlacement. They behave the
     same as {Row,Col}SmartPlacement when the window fits but fall back on
     minimizing overlap with other windows instead of CascadePlacement
   * Set IconicState on all unmapped clients and unmap clients with frames, as per ICCCM 4.1.4
   * Added ClientMenu key command, which pops up a menu of open windows, based on a pattern match
     - e.g. :ClientMenuworkspace=[current])(minimized=no)

*07/04/11:
   * Added resource session.screen<N>.maxIgnoreIncrement: <boolean>, to
     disable size checking when maximizing a window (e.g. terminals)
     - Also added a new configuration submenu for maximize options, to be filled at a later date
   * Added OnToolbar modifier to keys file
   * More changes to theme handling
     - introduced window.label.(un)focused.{justify,border{Color,Width}},
       which fallback to window.label.{justify,border{Color,Width}} before window.{justify,border{Color,Width}}
     - this has the backwards-incompatible effect that
       toolbar.iconbar.(un)focused.* fallback first to toolbar.iconbar.* and then to window.label.*
   * Added window.label.(un)focused.font to styles

*07/03/31:
   * [group] tag in apps file may now have a pattern appended to it, and a new
     window will only be automatically attached to the group if the group
     matches that pattern -- e.g. [group]workspace)(shaded=no) will only
     automatically group with windows on the current workspace that are not shaded
   * Lots of window commands now take a client pattern as an additional
     argument, and the command will then be applied to all matching windows

     - For example: `SendToWorkspace 2 (xterm)' will send all xterm windows to workspace 2
     - Here is the full list of affected commands (which is not to imply they
       all necessarily make sense to do): Fullscreen, Minimize, Maximize,
       MaximizeVertical, MaximizeHorizontal, SetAlpha, Resize, ResizeTo,
       ResizeHorizontal, ResizeVertical, MoveTo, Move, MoveRight, MoveLeft,
       MoveUp, MoveDown, Raise, RaiseLayer, Lower, LowerLayer, Close, Kill,
       Shade, Stick, ToggleDecor, SetHead, Tab, SendToNextWorkspace,
       SendToPrevWorkspace, TakeToNextWorkspace, TakeToPrevWorkspace,
       SendToWorkspace, TakeToWorkspace, NextTab, PrevTab, MoveTabLeft, MoveTabRight, DetachClient

*07/03/30:
   * Changed syntax for window cycling
     - Instead of a bitmask, the window cycling functions NextWindow,
       PrevWindow, TypeAheadFocus, and GoToWindow now take a list of options
       enclosed in {} followed by a pattern similar to those used in the apps file
     - Examples:
         * NextWindow {static groups}shaded=yes)(name=xterm)
           - cycles through all shaded xterms in creation order, only focusing the active tab in the group
         * GoToWindow 3title=[current]
           - focuses the third client in last-focused order with the same title as the currently focused window
     - The options are: name, class, title, role, maximized, minimized, shaded,
       stuck, focushidden (can't be disabled), iconhidden, workspacematches
       workspace names, not numbers), headnumbers), and layernames)
     - Parsing is a pain, so you'll have to update your keys file yourself for now

*07/03/29:
   * Removed groups file; entries will be added to the apps file automatically
   * Fixed a problem with programs starting in IconicState
   * Added new resource session.screen<N>.clientMenu.usePixmap that puts the
     window's icon in the workspace and icons menus: default true
     - For some reason, it doesn't work with un-shaped icons yet, but I've spent way too many hours already trying to figure out why
   * Use IconTitle in iconbar for minimized windows
   * Added new resource session.screen<N>.tabs.usePixmap that puts the window's
     icon in the tab, if available. This is on by default

*07/03/24:
   * Added new key command GoToWindow
     - Syntax is GoToWindow <int> [<bitmask>], where the int gives the position
       of the desired window with respect to a list of windows, and the bitmask
       is the same as for NextWindow. A negative number for <int> will count back from the end of the list
     - Particularly useful examples are GoToWindow <int> 9 and
       GoToWindow <int> 25, which will focus the window at position <int> in the
       iconbar modes Workspace and WorkspaceNoIcons, respectively
   * Fixed creation order window cycling with tabbed windows
*07/03/21:
   * Added new command TypeAheadFocus
     - syntax is the same as for NextWindow; when you run the command, you can
       start typing the title of the window, and it will gain focus; pressing
       tab will cycle through all matching entries using the options specified;
       when you've found the window you want, just press return or escape

      nogui) sets the vo driver name as the instance name
   * Fix menu heading encoding
     sf.net bug #1712583: NLS:Non-latin characters displayed incorrectly in menu title

--------------------------------
Changes for 1.0rc3:

*07/03/19:
   * Active menu item wasn't getting reset properly when menu closed
   * Fixed some problems with toolbar sizing

*07/03/18:
   * Changed position remembering so it only remembers position relative to the current head
   * Fixed problem with new mouse binding code when using emacs keychains

*07/03/17:
   * Iconified, stuck windows weren't being moved to different workspaces

*07/03/16:
   * Maximizing a window with aspect ratio requirements was making windows too large
   * Added key command to open a custom menu file
     - :CustomMenu /path/to/file

*07/03/11:
   * Fixed display bug with ParentRelative menu highlight

*07/03/10:
   * Autogrouped windows weren't getting added to the workspace menu
   * Changed default toolbar layer to DOCK, as a large window could render fluxbox useless to a new user otherwise
   * Fixed changing iconbar text padding requiring a toolbar refresh
   * Fixed stealing focus from unmanaged windows
   * Fixed a little bug with reverting focus after closing menu
   * Changed some handling of focusing/raising transient windows
   * session.screen<N>.defaultDeco now allows same strings as apps file
   * Added typeahead support to menus
     - Added new style item menu.frame.underlineColor: <color> for displaying matching items
   * Added support for keypad enter key in menu
   * Fixed some strange menu behaviors
   * Respect external tabs in ArrangeWindows
   * Update EWMH state atom when maximizing windows
   * Update titlebar buttons on reconfigure
   * Make systemtray support XEMBED protocol
   * Buttons should only run a command if the mouse was clicked down on the same button, e.g. bug #1437864
   * Slit was creating a strut even when it wasn't visible
   * Update workspace names on reconfigure, and don't overwrite workspace names not being used
   * Fixed some issues with transients of inactive tabs

   * Fixed a bug with `session.ignoreBorder: true'
   * Fixed a bug with resizing windows for clients when only the width is specified
   * Introduced support for mouse buttons in the keys file
     - Mouse buttons are bound to new `keys' Mouse1, Mouse2, etc
     - Also a new modifier `OnDesktop' to specify actions that should take place
       when you click on the desktop -- without this, mouse bindings are global
     - Obviously, more modifiers are planned, so don't ask
     - Introduced new command HideMenus
     - Added a utility to the project that automatically updates configuration
       files when we change the syntax -- your current mouse bindings on the
       desktop will be added to your keys file automatically
   * Wrong window was being raised when attaching an unfocused window
   * Make selecting `close' from the workspace menu close the correct client,
     rather than the active tab in the window -- selecting `close' from right
     clicking on a tab is still wrong, as there are complications
   * Made some changes to the way autogrouping in the apps file works
     - Introduced new syntax [group] (workspace) to group new windows only with windows on the current workspace
     - Fixed an unreported bug with grouping windows on multiple screens
     - Groups are now associated with clients rather than windows, so they
       will be more robust when attaching or detaching tabs and when restarting fluxbox
   * Layer wasn't set properly on remembered windows, and the layer menu
     wasn't getting updated properly, bugs #1535304, #1572683, #1646740
   * Clicking on the edge of a button didn't work, bugs #1060891, #1517747

*07/02/02:
   * Reverted patch from svn 4684, allowing transparency in window buttons,
     until we get it working with titlebar transparency, since the old buggy
     behavior at least didn't break settings already in use
   * Update window transparency immediately when using pseudotransparency,
     also introduced new key command: SetAlpha [[+-]<int> [[+-]<int>]]
     - with no arguments, returns the focused window to default settings
     - with one argument, changes both focused and unfocused settings the same way
     - with two arguments, the first changes the focused alpha, and the second changes the unfocused alpha
     E.g. SetAlpha 127 +5 will set the focused alpha to 127 and increment the unfocused alpha by 5until it reaches 255

*07/01/26:
   * Fix default workspace names, and don't show empty menus
   * Opening a window on a different workspace with Focus New Windows enabled
     should focus the window when you get to that workspace -- as a free bonus,
     stacking order should be more stable on fluxbox restart
   * Don't raise any windows above OverrideRedirect windows, otherwise they
     eventually get pushed to the bottomm, bug #1447583
   * Detect user's shell from environment rather than assuming /bin/sh

*07/01/21:
   * Little fix for closing tabs with non-default gravity
     Window.cc

     - always give focus to the menu with the highlighted item
     - revert focus to menu when no other windows will take it
     - don't reopen closed submenus when moving the menu

*07/01/20:
   * Make sure styles don't change the lastwallpaper in fbsetbg
   * Let styles override rootCommand in init file -- for the old behavior, add `background: none' to the overlay file
   * Don't place windows over toolbar at the top of the screen

*07/01/16:
   * Make right-clicking on iconbar button behave the same way as tabs
   * Don't force user to reconfigure manually in order to apply menu and
     default window transparency changes; instead, in order to conserve system
     resources, do it a half-second after the user stops changing them

*07/01/15:
   * Prevent per-window alpha menu from scrolling past 0 or 255
   * Fix rootmenu disappearing on reconfigure

*07/01/14:
   * Stay on the same workspace after a restart
   * Properly 'properly fix' shaded and stuck windows on restart -- i.e. allow
     windows to deiconify themselves the rest of the time
   * Several changes for background style option:
     - now support `background: mod' to coincide with fbsetroot -mod --
       In addition to `background.color' and `background.colorTo', this option
       must also set `background.modX' and `background.modY' to integers
     - added `background: none' for styles that do not include a background
     - fixed bug with style backgrounds not getting set when changing styles
     - updated default styles to be valid wrt background options
   * Minor fix for window cycling on multiple screens

*07/01/13:
   * Only change focus order when user specifically focuses a window

*07/01/11:
   * Added option to :Minimize key command to lower all windows in the same
     layer as the focused window -- syntax is `:Minimizelayer)'

*07/01/08:
   * Fix another 64-bit window property

*07/01/07:
   * Update Iconbar Mode menu when updating settings
   * Fixed workspace warping going crazy, bug #1467124
   * Fix little bug with iconbar rendering, bug #1549209
   * Fix RefCount crash and Slit deconstruction ordering
   * Support per-window transparency settings.
       sf.net patch #1511042, feature #1108692
      - new "Transparency" menu in the window menu
      - new apps file attribute:
         [alpha] {int int}or just {int}
        Where numbers represent focused and unfocused transparency,
        respectively. One number only will be used for both
      - Also, show toggle status for shade and stick in window menu

*07/01/06:
   * Changing session.forcePseudotransparency no longer requires restart, also a little code cleanup in FbTk/Transparent.cc/hh
   * Move triangle drawing into a generic function in FbDrawable
     Make submenu triangles in MenuItems proportional to the icon size alternate implementation of sf.net patch #1526813

*07/01/05:
   * When a client in an unfocused tab creates a transient window, set that client to the active tab
   * Window wasn't staying focused when dragging across workspaces with outline window moving
   * Fix placement of window menu with toolbar at the top of the screen, and remove titlebar from window menu
   * Don't change focus to a window that doesn't accept focus
   * Only grab keybindings on screens managed by fluxbox
   * Fix locale being applied to the clock.
     - Also fixed a likely locale-killer for BSDswithout nl_langinfo
   * Fix nls digit strings to prefix with zero "%4d" => "%04d" for proper spacing
   * Fix loading of rotated fonts on style change
   * Change default Xft font to "monospace"was "fixed"
     - The "fixed" font loads a bitmap Xfont
     - Note that bitmap fonts do not rotate properly, and especially the
       baseline isn't adjusted for the lack of rotation. Thus we recommend
       that if you are using a bitmapped font (e.g. artwiz), then specify it
       using xfld style-*-snap-*-*-* ...etc) so that fluxbox loads it with
       traditional XFont/XmbFont calls, resulting in correct placement and rotation

*07/01/04:
   * Added new resource for init file to control default window decorations:
     session.screenN.defaultDeco: <bitmask>, where the bitmask corresponds to the one used for [Deco] in the apps file
   * Move minimized windows to the back of the focused list
   * Don't run [startup] items in apps file on fluxbox restart
   * Don't escape regular expression metacharacters in apps file, bug #1595497
   * Don't draw style's menu icon pixmap underneath the program's icon
   * Don't run [startup] items in apps file if fluxbox fails to start
   * Don't run [startup] items in apps file on reconfigure
   * Fix data type of data passed to set _NET_FRAME_EXTENTS  sf.net #1621980
     Similar fix for gnome current workspace... remember that XA_CARDINAL
     "32-bit" type is actually a "long array" argument=64bit on 64 systems
   * Update window scroll action (and direction) on reconfigure
   * Update toolbar visibility on reconfigure
   * Don't add 2 pixels to a specified toolbar height, bug #1528646
   * Allow focus to revert to stuck windows
   * Don't assume "Jump" and "*Hidden" say "yes" in apps file
   * Jump to autogrouped windows on another workspace if set to do so in apps file
   * Fixed a few bugs with tabbed windows on restart
   * Little simplification of data structure for keybindings
     Side effects:
     - "Mod4 a b" now behaves like "Mod4 a None b" -- in fact, "None" is now completely obsolete
     - You can press "Escape" to cancel any Emacs-style keychain in progress unless it's bound to something else
     - If there is a conflict between bindings, the first one in the file wins
     - Fixes handling of keychains like "Mod4 a Mod1 b"
     - Should fix some issues with "None" modifier
   * Rotate items in toolbar the same way as tabs
   * Stop cycling focus when any other command is run, e.g. bug #1595336
   * Remove useless stuff from code that reloads configuration
   * Cosmetic patch from Slava Semushin
   * Cosmetic patch from Slava Semushin
   * Changed mode for .fluxbox/startup to 644
     some people on noexec-mounted partitions ran into problems
   * Added CachedPixmap
   * Fixed bug #1561482,
     Crash when clicking on the workspacename to get the tbarmenu
     Fixed so it recreated toolbar menu if needed in  Toolbar::reconfigure
   * fixed little issue in fbsetbg
     if someone has no wpsetters installed at all but only wants to use
     fbsetroot thru fbsetbg then the warning would pop up, telling her
     to install a wpsetter .. which she doenst want
   * Fix minor menu separator highlight issue

*06/08/12:
   * Fix placement of restored fullscreen windows
   * Fix crash in ClientPattern when more than one pattern in [app] line
   * Implement _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_MENU and _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_TOOLBAR
   * Fix duplicated UTF-8 encoding in el_GR
   * Remove some old code that messed up placing submenus
   * Documented background style option
   * Distinguish between startup and restart
   * Don't call placement strategy on maximized or fullscreen windows
   * Allow aspect/centered/tiled options with random background in fbsetbg
   * Don't re-apply remembered settings on restart if they are set as window properties
   * Don't raise a window after cycling if it has been minimized
   * Added support for negative arguments to the `Tab' key command to count backwards from the last tab in the group
   * Rename session.screen*.iconbar.deiconifyMode to  session.screen*.userFollowModel
     This resource is used for:
     - clicking a window on a different workspace in the iconbar
     - _NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW messages where the source is a pager
     - clicking a client in the workspace menuand the opposite is used for right clicks
     Possible values are:
     - Follow: go to the workspace of the selected window
     - Current: bring the window to the current workspace
     - SemiFollow: act like Current for iconified windows, else Follow
     - Ignore: leave it alone
   * Update _NET_WORKAREA on screen dimension change
   * Fix ClickTabFocus and MouseTabFocus in nls

*06/07/30:
   * List windows in iconbar in creation order
   * Don't jump to remembered apps on restart
   * Make _NET_CLIENT_LIST report windows in creation order - still need to fix _NET_CLIENT_LIST_STACKING
   * Set _NET_WM_DESKTOP appropriately on remembered windows
   * Don't change the order of creating windows with transients on restart
     Rather, just move the transient to the end of the list. This preserves the
     focused order and also reduces the complexity to O(n)
   * Fixed torn menus so they don't close on exec items
   * Added resource and menu item for maximizing over external tabs
   * Fix so that focus doesn't revert away from command dialogs
   * Fix background style item so that it works when the previous style didn't have one set

   * Changing between internal and external tabs didn't affect iconified windows
   * Still trying to get the focus right: bug #1517750
   * Fix crash on startup on some platforms
   * Fix some sizing issues from gravity change patch FbWinFrame.hh/cc Window.cc
   * Auto-grouped windows using groups file didn't raise Workspace.cc

     Window.cc

*06/07/03:
   * fix+improve handling of window gravity, was very broken
     - caused (among others) windows with gravity set to get relocated on close
     - gravity is now taken into account on style change
   * make our default locale, init, menu, and style paths properly
     expand PREFIX in the make install stage, so that make prefix=elsewhere

   * Fix [ 1512046 ] "window.label.unfocus.pixmap" doesn't update
     - FbPixmap::copy was keeping the same pixmap if they had same
       dimensions. This effectively broke the image cache
   * Explicitly map NoSymbol to keycode 0 seems to be assigned to several keycodes
   * Menu aware of text encodings
     - new menu file options:
         [encoding] {CODESET}
           ...
         [endencoding]
     - All distributions are encouraged to use these inside any
       auto-generated menu files, so that they are independent of user encoding
     - Encoding defaults to user's current encoding
   * Fix crash when unable to convert between local and utf-8 encodings
   * Fix DetachClient key command so new window is visible
   * Make Urgency Hint flash the correct tab in a group

     new Command: SetModKey <modkey>
     eg: session.modKey: Mod4   allows to use the winkey to resize and move
     windows and have Mod1 (Alt) free for using blender or Maya
   * Fix nls
     - file location was wrong. nls wouldn't have worked, why did no-one say?
     - Messages output on stdout/err now properly in local encoding
     - Check for existence of catalog file, if it doesn't exist, and we can
       convert from UTF-8, try loading that one instead
     - bunch of files changed due to macro name change:
       + Use _FB_XTEXT if the text will go out to Xfor X fonts

     This make apps, that support this hint, flash the titlebar and iconbar when they want attention
     For example gaim


*06/06/10:
   * Added new command: ToggleCmd
     Works like a macro but executes the commands one at the time in order
     Example:
     Mod1 T :ToggleCmd {Exec xterm} {NextWindow}
     When Mod1 T is press the first time it will start xterm, the second time
     it will do NextWindow. When it reaches end it will start at the beginning
   * Fixed resize box bug
     The text used to determine the size used space, which could have
     different width than characters on some fonts
   * Pressing shift while pressing enter in menu item will fake a
     right mouse button press. Useful when inc/decrease alpha/size in menu

     - I18N::getMessage now returns FbString's
     - Menu labels are passed as FbString&e s, not char *s
   * Fix transparency on multiple screens & possibly bad root bg atom reading
   * Fix bug with horizontal maximisation when quadrant resizing
   * Fixed some title redraw issues
   * Added support for _NET_WM_STATE_DEMANDS_ATTENTION .
     When this state is set fluxbox will start flashing
     the titlebar and button in the toolbar. It will stop when the window is focused.
     The blink rate can be configured with the following resource:
     session.screen0.demandsAttentionTimeout: <timeout in milliseconds>
     Default value is 500
     If the value is zero this feature will be disabled
   * Handle EMWH window and icon titles, plus localise workspace names
     - FbTk::FbWindow::textProperty now handles utf8 type, and always
       returns UTF-8 encoded stringsfor internal use
   * Handle UTF-8 strings properly
     - still need to integrate EWMH strings properlythey are utf8
     - still need to fix up TextBox
   * Make apps file keywords case insensitive, plus reload it (if newer)
     before save on close and remember menu events
   * Fix resizing of client window when autogroup from apps

   * Add option to reverse desktop wheeling, patch #1034287
       session.screen0.reversewheeling: true|false
   * Set (take|send)to(next|prev)workspace offset default value to 1
     instead of the current 0 (which makes them look non-functional)
     Similarly for tab and|next|prev|left|right workspace
   * Add "CloseAllWindows" key binding

     - Useful to trigger all "close" actions before flux exit (or other) to catch any pending file saves etc...
   * Fix all warnings with (gcc 3.4.6) -Wall, mainly sign comparisons
   * signedness fix in Container moveItem
   * Vertical toolbar

     on 64-bit platformssf.net #1467871,
   * Fix updating of button stateesp stick/shade
    sf.net #1281724, #1213257
   * Provide "Key Modes"
     - New action in keys file:
         Modifier Key :Keymode <Name> <End Modifier> <End Key>
       Will define a keybinding namespace activated by the given mod/key
       combination. The End Modifier and key are optional. They define
       the key combination that quits the given key mode. They default to just 'Escape'.
     - New keys file optional prefix:
         <Name>: Modifier Key :Command
       will only work when the <Name> keymode is activated
     - <Name> is  "default" if not specified - so:
        **default commands will not be activated inside another keymode**
     - Handy Example:
        Mod1 X :KeyMode XNest
        XNest: Mod1 X :KeyMode default
       Will switch to XNest keymode when you press Alt-X. Then the
       default bindings will not be caught by normal fluxbox, and will
       pass through to an Xnested one! Groovy... Alt-X will switch back to normal
   * Ensure applying of size hints while maximizing
   * Fix calculation of prevWorkspace
   * Fix label background update with external tabs
   * Fix build on amd64 - some more size_t propagation and includes

   * Fix gcc 2.95.4 build error in ScreenPlacement.hh
   * Fix tabs on other workspaces being shown on placement change
     + Fix XmbFonts for multiple screens. Still need to fix XFontImp, it's quite a bit more convoluted
   * Rotated Xmb Fonts
     - rotated when drawn. Probably not very efficient for
       parentrelative backgrounds. If it proves an issue, we should
       probably cache recently-drawn strings so we can just re-stipple
   * Rotated X Fonts again, plus minor external tab alignment fixes
     - Still need to do XmbFonts. Most people probably load those
       instead of XFont these days. Will need yet another approach...
   * size_t fixes

*06/03/27:
   * Fix crash when deiconifying stuck windows with Follow mode
   * Don't Follow stuck windows on deiconify, since they're stuck

   * Related to external
     - Fix title alignment
     - Fix "jumpy" vertical tabs on tab size change & other change-related
     - Fix alignment error for left-hand vertical tabs
   * More external tabs work AND rotated Xft text
     - new tab positionsLeftTop, LeftBottom, etc
     - TextButtons and Containers can have orientation set on them
     - XftFonts store all rotated versions (if used),
       so the theme doesn't need to know about it. Pixmaps are also auto-rotated
     - TODO: Update XFontImp rotation code
     - Note: many files touched because constness removed from many fonts
   * Fix compile error in Theme.ccsf.net bug #1454204
   * Fixed apps filename on save
   * Fixed duplicate ClickToFocus menu item
   * Fix some tab stacking alignment and rendering on tab resize and very minor tidying

     - New tab.width config option to control external tab width
     - edge snapping includes tabs
     - decoration fixes where some missed the tab option
     - label text color was not updated
   * Fixed some minor typos
   * Fix placement config (some compilers resulted in ignoring of
     placement policy setting), and a minor ext. tabs placement bug
   * External tabs
     - option in Configure menu to enable
       - restart require at present when toggling this option
     - New apps pnemonic for "Deco" option: TAB, which is like NONE,
       but with an external tab
     Notes:
     - tab width currently hardcoded
     - only alignment is topleft

-------------------------------------------------------------
Changes for 0.9.15:

*06/03/19:

   * Added 'random' and 'aspect' options to background theme
   * New theme item:
      background: <texture option>
      background.pixmap: <image filename>
      background.color: <color>
      background.colorTo: <color>
     The background.pixmap filename will be sent to "fbsetbg"
     which in turn sets the background
     The following options will be available for the background.pixmap:
       - tiled
       - centered
     For example:
       background: tiled
       background.pixmap: someimage.png
     and it can also generate a normal texture:
       background: gradient
       background.color: blue
       background.colorTo: green
     The rootCommand in the style is now obsolete and
     if the "background" item is not found in the style then the default
     background will be black and with a warning text

   * Added styleOverlay resource to init-file
       session.styleOverlay: ~/.fluxbox/overlay
     Style settings in this file override any settings from a
     regular style

Changes for 0.9.14:

*05/09/12:
   * Fixes #1281708, MenuIcon doesnt scale properly

*05/09/08:
   * Fixed bug in client menu. Window menu did not open
   * Add titlebar scrolling options
     New init options:
       session.screenN.windowScrollAction: Shade|NextTab
       - set the action that happens when scrolling on the titlebar
       session.screenN.windowScrollReverse: true|false
       - reverse the action direction
   * Added Feature Request #1084510
     When Mod1 + LeftMouse are clicked on a Window and the mouse is not
     moved, the window is raised at LeftMouseRelease
   * Exchanged the hardcoded 3200 pixel limit for texture size to
     a calculated value based on screen dimensions
   * Added SVN Revision number output in info output
   * Fixed unresolved symbols when configure --disable-regexp
   * Added the 'Education' submenu to fbgm
    Fix for #1240248, Segfaults for :MoveTabLeft/Right
    Changed some *Focus options
    removed SloppyFocus, SemiSloppyFocus and ClickToFocus options
    added MouseFocus, ClickFocus, MouseTabFocus, ClickTabFocus
    - MouseFocus - change the focus to the window under the mouse
     almost similar to the 'old' SloppyFocus
    - ClickFocus - change the focus to the window the user clicks
    - MouseTabFocus - change active tabclient to the one under the
      mouse in titlebar, does NOT change the focus
    - ClickTabFocus - change active tabclient when clicked onto a tabbutton
    to achieve former SemiSloppyFocus behavior one needs MouseFocus and
    ClickTabFocus
    Dragging a tab button from current titlebar onto current client area will
    detach that client
    Renaming of 'bsetroot' to 'fbsetroot'
    blackbox's 'bsetroot' and fluxbox's 'bsetroot' have different syntax
    nowadays and collide when you install fluxbox and blackbox. hence
    the renaming
    updated manpage, helper utilsfbgm, startfluxbox, fbsetbg), nls etc
*05/07/06:
    Added even more applications to fbgm
  * Added info about locale path in -info argument
  * Respect border size in the MoveTo action
  * Added kcommander, Valknut, dcgui-qt, quickdc, asami, amsn to fbgm
  * Fix #1223780, fbgm updated
    - added gnome-alsamixer
    - use "kfmclient openProfile filemanagement" for konqueror as filebrowser
  * Fix for clock displaying %S too late sometimes
  * Fix for toggling the toolbar doesnt update strut
  * Little reordering of ToolbarMenu items
  * Moved window menu from FluxboxWindow to BScreen, so
    we now use one window menu per screen instead of one menu per window,
    thus saving memory and increasing speed
  * Fix shaded + iconic windows + restart
    - use ATTRIB_HIDDEN, can't use IconicState

  * Revert shaded window fix. Wrong approach and caused crashes
  * Change FbWinFrame to use a Container
  * Fixes #1206821, unportable usage of grep in fbgm
  * Fixes #1116965, #1047529, shaded windows on restart
  * little Fix for font effects

*05/06/15:
  * Enhanced MoveTo, fixes #1074568
      MoveTo <int|*> <int|*> <Reference Corner>
       - * means "use current value"
       - Reference Corner is one of:
         - UpperLeft, Upper, UpperRight
         - Left, Right
         - LowerLeft, Lower, Right
       examples:
         MoveTo 0 * Left       -> snap to left workspace edge
         MoveTo * 0 Lower      -> snap to lower workspace edge
         MoveTo 0 0 UpperRight -> snap to upper right workspace corner
  * Fixes #1198192, vlc to fbgm
  * Fixes #1213003, SendToWorkspace shouldnt follow
      - SendToWorkspace silently changes the workspace of the window
      - TakeToWorkspace takes the window and puts it onto the ws
  * Fixes #1216020, *.font.effect wont get cleared if not defined in style

*05/06/09:
  * Reordering of the WorkspaceMenu
    Icon submenu ontop, workspaces below, new|edit|remove on bottom
  * Fixed justification in WorkspaceNameTool #1213262
  * Massive change of font handling
    - Usage of xft-fonts is prefered, except a font-description starts with '-'
    - Removed "antialias"-option completly, to enable/disable "antialias"
      use either  <fontname>:antialias=<bool> in the style or use
      Xft.antialias: <bool> in your .Xdefaults
    - Added new styleresources:
        *.font.effect: <halo|shadow>
        *.font.shadow.x : <int>       - shadow x offset
        *.font.shadow.y : <int>       - shadow y offset
        *.font.shadow.color : <color> - color of shadow
        *.font.halo.color : <color>   - color of halo
    - Removed 'shadow' and 'halo' options from fontdefinitions:
        !! Style authors have to update their styles !!
    - Simplified XmbFontImp to not try all possible fonts to match locale
    - Style authors may specify multiple fonts:
        <font1>|<font2>|<font3>
      if loading of font1 fails, fluxbox probes <font2>, etc. The last font is
      "fixed". Hints for style authors:
        - if xft tries to load a font it will _ALWAYS_ return a valid font,
          it doesnt have to look like the one you want to have, read more
          about it: http://fontconfig.org/fontconfig-user.html
        - export XFT_DEBUG=1  before running fluxbox helps to see which fonts are picked
      eg:
          *.font: Verdana,Arial-12:antialias=true|-artwiz-snap-*-
          if fluxbox is compiled with xft this will NEVER try to load "-artwiz-snap-*-" since xft gives for sure a font,
          most likely Verdana or Arial but noone knows. So, if fluxbox has no xft support the first fontpattern fails
          and fluxbox tries the next one, which might be successful. If everything fails, it will use "fixed"
    - Added caching of fonts, fonts are only loaded once
    - Fixed #1090902

*05/06/02:
  * Fixed _BLACKBOX_NOTIFY_WINDOW_ADD issue
    _BLACKBOX_NOTIFY_WINDOW_ADD was emited before _NET_CLIENT_LIST
    and _NET_CLIENT_LIST_STACKING lists updates
  * Fixed iconified windows disappear from _NET_CLIENT_LIST
  * Fixes for _NET* hints
    - _NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN now correctly used
    - _NET_WM_STATE_SKIP_PAGER not longer deleted from state
    - _NET_WM_STATE_SKIP_TASKBAR not longer mixed with _HIDDEN
  * Bugfix, install directory for keys, menu, init

  * Keycodes can now be used in the keys file
    Example:
    None 10 :NextWorkspace
   10 - keycode for '1'
    Useful for keys that have no symbol

  * Added new configure option --with-locale=path redirects location of nls directories
  * Fix systemtray overlap
  * Fix some Ewmh/Gnome issues
    +  _NET_CLIENT_LIST and _NET_CLIENT_LIST_STACKING not updated
       when sending _BLACKBOX_NOTIFY_WINDOW_DEL
    + _NET_WM_DESKTOP and _WIN_WORKSPACE had wrong initial values-1), which led to probems witheg) fbpager

-------------------------------------------------------------
Changes for 0.9.13

*05/05/13:
  * Fix a segfault crash, and a similar potential one
  * Fixed configure.in for iconv for different platforms
  * Fixed setenv/putenv issues on platforms which dont support setenv
    we now use only putenv() and manage the used values on our own
  * Fixed compile issues on Darwin/MacOSX
  * Fixed problem when app changes the app-pixmap
  * Fixed missing header
  * Fixed some FbTk_istringstream issues for gcc295*
  * Cache root pixmap, watch for property changes
   previously was checked EVERY time = lots
  * minor tweak to configure.in
  * Fix for fbrun and completion
  * Fix for gentoo-bug #91955
    Remembering the position of a window didnt store the reference corner
  * Remove default "gray" background
  * Fix titlebar transparency in sometabbed) cases
  * Added new Buttons for the Titlebar of a Window
    - Shade - just like the "Stick"-button
      Styleresources:
        window.shade.pixmap, window.shade.unfocus.pixmap, window.shade.pressed.pixmap
        window.unshade.pixmap, window.unshade.unfocus.pixmap, window.unshade.pressed.pixmap etc.
    - MenuIcon - click on it provides the windowmenu, if the app
      contains a pixmapgvim, konqueror etc etc) the pixmap is displayed, a little menu otherwise
      Styleresources:
        window.menuicon.pixmap, window.menuicon.unfocus.pixmap window.menuicon.pressed.pixmap etc.
    Example ~/.fluxbox/init - entry:
      session.titlebar.left: MenuIcon Stick
      session.titlebar.right: Shade Minimize Maximize Close
  * xrestop should now display "Fluxbox"
  * Fix potential segfault menu bug,
    Switching to a secondary/third keyboard layout via the xkb-extensions
    leads to broken NextWindow/PrevWindow and broken fbrun/CommandDialog:
    - be aware of what xkb is doing to the event.state

*05/05/03:
  * Fix drawing of no-title menus, plus updating of int menu items
    Fluxbox::associateClient; creates tab and maps WinClient to label button
  * Added FbTk::Select2nd + more code cleaning
    This returns .second from operator)(Someclass &a)
    Useful for std::map loops
  * Create/delete tabs with FbWinFrame::createTab/removeTab
  * Fix #1086673 ArrangeWindows on shaded aterms causes inconsistency
    we now place shaded Windows above the normal windows. ArrangeWindows
    touches only windows on the currentxinerama)-head

*05/04/29:
  * Added new IconbarModes:
       NoIcons          - all but iconified windows
       WorkspaceNoIcons - all but iconified windows on the current ws
  * Fixed transient bug
    #1157361 inconsistent behavior of Java dialogs
    Transients that are created before the transient_for window gets copied to a transient_for waiting list and when the
    transient_for window is created the transients are updated. When raising a transient window the window gets placed last
    in the transient list so it gets raised last and thus gets places above
  * Fix some initialisation, plus setting background too much
  * Add some extremely basic handling for icon pixmaps that aren't
    the same depth as the screentreat all as 1-bit, easy to handle

  * Fix a bunch more issues with recent patches
    - Clock text colour on start
    - Resizing not updating in some cases
    - menu separators not being drawn
  * Close #1107216, minor fbgm-issue, cosmetic startfluxboxfrom the OpenBSD patches
  * Fix #1182770
    session.screen*.workspaces: <int> and the number of workspaces in the running fluxbox were out of sync and lead to
    segfault on a "reloadconfig"-Command
  * Fix drawing when transparency off
  * Fix systray icon sizing (send a configurenotify on resize)
  * Extension of previous patch, pushing various bits of menu items and
    text buttons onto the background, and fixing various issues
    + Incidentally, adds some new theme itemsdue to backwards
      compatibility fix):
      - menu.hilite.submenu.pixmap:    <Pixmap>
      - menu.hilite.selected.pixmap:   <Pixmap>
      - menu.hilite.unselected.pixmap: <Pixmap>
    These are equivalent to the no-.hilite ones, except are shown when the item is highlighted...
  * Fixed #1188690, fbrun segfault
  * Close of #956325
       WorkspaceMenu -> left click on a item will jump TO that workspace
                     -> middle click will fetch it to the current workspace
       SendToMenu    -> left click send it quietly
                     -> middle click send it and follows to that workspace
    This should now match whats written in the manpage
  * Fixed #960535 aka Deiconify with apps set 'sticky'
  * Fixed #1020399 aka broken ShowDesktop - command
  * clear maximized-Flags of a resized/moved Window
  * fixed Iconified+Sticky Windows not shown in Iconbar when in WorkspaceIcons-Mode
  * Fixed iconv-issues on *BSD/MacOSX
  * Fixed #1133809, ArrangeWindows covers Toolbar/Slit
  * Fixed problem with _NET_WM_STRUT
  * Fixed problem with WindowSnapping
  * Fixed #1170056, Moving tab beyong last right tab causes malfunction
  * Fixed a few drawing bugs created by last patch (titlebar no clear on resize, menu opening offscreen...)

*05/04/11:
  * Rework lots of stuff relating to transparency, esp menus+frame
    + Massively reduce pixmap memory usage (view with xrestop)
    + Should also improve startup+style change times, esp for large menus
    + This introduces a few rendering bugs, but I'd like stuff tested
    + Transparency is done differently now. People shouldn't need to call updateTransparent
    + Do not use persistent pixmap buffers unless you're sure!
      XSetWindowBackground already copies/buffers the set pixmap, so
      things need to be rendered to a temp pixmap once, then can be freed
    Known bugs:
     - different focus/unfocus transparency doesn't update labelbuttons properly. Workaround: use same transparency for both.
     - Text sometimes gets overdrawn a lot. Probably should render it to
       background using a virtual hook in FbWindow::updateBackground
     - Changing style resizes things, not all pixmaps updated properly
       Workaround: restart fluxbox after changing style
     - Probably breaks Composite support.
    TODO:
     + FbPixmap::getRootPixmap called very often. It should cache the result and watch the relevant properties

*05/04/09:
  * minor fix to startfluxbox
  * Minor tweak for the buildsystem so it doesnt compile
    defaults.cc every time
  * Tidy up some redundant pixmap allocations
  * added "Fullscreen" as a command
  * some additions to fbgm, mostly cosmetic

*05/03/16:
  * added -c <startupfile> to 'startfluxbox'
  * fix for gravity field on _NET_MOVERESIZE_WINDOW
  * added new option to specify, on which screen fluxbox should handle
    the windows. default behavior is to handle each available screen

    [layer], [sendto]
    + the all the other menu items that you can use in the normal
      root menui.e [exec]aterm) {aterm})
    The [extramenus] will add  "remember" menu
    example: session.screen0.windowMenu: ~/.fluxbox/windowmenu
        [begin]
        [exec]aterm) {aterm}
        [maximize]

*03/12/12:
  * Added menu delay/click to open or close submenus
    In menuMode: Click you need to click on the menu item to open it
    The menuDelay is the delay to open an submenu.
    The menuDelayClose is so you don't need to aim that much when
    you're moving the cursor to the submenu, over the item below or above, so it stays visible.
    new resource items:
    session.screen0.menuMode:  can be either Click or Delay (default: Delay)
    session.screen0.menuDelay:  in msec ( default: 0 )
    session.screen0.menuDelayClose: in msec ( default: 0 )
    example:
    session.screen0.menuMode: Delay
    session.screen0.menuDelay: 400
    session.screen0.menuDelayClose: 300
    Notice how the menuDelay is a bit larger than menuCloseDelay
    this is so the previous menu can close before you open the next

  * Removed Next/Prev client from window menu
  * Added aligment for buttons in iconbar
    Change Left, Relative or Right via the Iconbar mode menu
